1,NA,"not vetted","Weed management in organic dryland wheat production in the Pacific Northwest","Growth in demand for organic small grains has increased interest in producing certified organic crops in the semiarid US Pacific Northwest. The region is well-suited for small grain production, and there is a strong market for organic food products on the US West Coast. However, many growers encounter significant and persistent challenges with weed management, particularly management of perennial weeds such as Canada thistle [Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.] and field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.), but also common winter and spring annual grass weeds including cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and wild oat (Avena fatua L.). Coupled with the need to minimize soil disturbance, weed management can become nearly intractable and production limiting. From 2004 to 2024, several short and intermediate studies have been conducted to assess weed control tactics and crop rotation effects on weed management. Lessons learned include incorporating alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) into rotations for suppression of field bindweed, or alfalfa and winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) for suppression of Canada thistle. Optimization of cultural inputs, particularly seeding rate, are critical for each crop in rotation. Animal integration and new crops such as quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) are alternatives to conventional crops and potentially profitable. Incorporation of precision mechanical and chemical systems is feasible in narrow-row cereals, and when combined with crop rotation, it could reduce or eliminate the need for repeated transitions back to convention production for organic growers.Weed management for organic cereal production in the Pacific Northwest requires the use of all of the above approach. Crop rotation, diversification, and optimized cultural inputs are essential for the management of perennial weeds. The combination of mechanical weed control and precision guidance systems is essential for organic weed management. Organic herbicides are economically feasible to use when combined with an optical sensor sprayer system.","Marta"
2,NA,"not vetted","Camelina as a Rotation Crop for Weed Control in Organic Farming in a Semiarid Mediterranean Climate","Crop rotation in winter cereals in semiarid Mediterranean climates is highly desirable to prevent weed infestations, but the climatic conditions make it difficult to implement alternative crops to winter cereals. Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) is an interesting option, as it is able to produce profitable yields thanks to its tolerance to cold and drought. In this work, three autumn-winter sowing dates (SD1, October; SD2, December; SD3, January) and two sowing rates (R1, 8 kg ha(-1); R2, 11 kg ha(-1)) were chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of these cultural methods to control weeds over three seasons, and to determine effects on camelina seed yield. Results showed that a significant reduction of weed coverage was obtained by delaying the sowing date. Sowing rates did not show differences in weed coverage. In contrast, no apparent yield penalty was observed among sowing dates and rates. These results show that the introduction of camelina as a rotational crop in semiarid Mediterranean climates is a feasible option for helping to suppress winter weeds, as well as to provide productive seed yield in these climatic conditions.","Marta"

We evaluated pea growth, yield, and water use in response to tillage, crop rotation, and weed management practice from 2005 to 2010 in the northern Great Plains, United States. Tillage systems were no-tillage and conventional tillage, and crop rotations were spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-pea (W-P), spring wheat-forage barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.)-pea (W-B-P), and spring wheat-forage barley-corn (Zea mays L.)-pea (W-B-C-P). Weed managements were traditional (conventional seeding rates, early planting, broadcast N fertilization, and reduced stubble height) and improved (variable seeding rates, delayed planting, banded N fertilization, and increased stubble height) practices. Pea plant stand, height, pod number, grain and biomass yields, and water-use efficiency (WUE) were 4 to 23% greater with the improved than the traditional weed management practice, but seed number per pod was 5% greater with the traditional practice. Plant height, pod number, biomass and grain yields, preplant and post-harvest soil water contents, and WUE were 2 to 51% greater with W-B-P and W-B-C-P than W-P. Pea yield and WUE increased with extended crop rotation with nonlegumes and the improved weed management due to enhanced plant growth and seed characteristics as a result of greater soil water availability, seeding rate, and wheat stubble height. Dryland pea yield and water use can be enhanced by using extended diversified crop rotations and by increasing seeding rate and wheat stubble height.","Marta"

We compared sheep grazing, tillage, and herbicide application as weed management practices on soil total C (STC), total N (STN), ammonium (NH4+)-N, and nitrate (NO3-)-N contents in a dryland 5-year crop rotation from 2012 to 2015 in the northern Great Plains, USA. The treatments were sheep grazing with no chemical input in organic crop production (GO), minimum tillage with chemical inputs (MT), and conventional tillage with no chemical input in organic crop production (TO). The 5-year crop rotation was safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.)/sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) cover crop-sweet clover cover crop-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-lentil (Lens culinaris L.)-winter wheat. At the 0-1.20 m depth, STC was 14-20 Mg C ha(-1) greater in GO than MT and TO, but STN was 2.1-2.2 Mg N ha(-1) greater in TO than GO and MT. The NH4+-N and NO3--N contents were 5 21 kg N ha(-1) greater in MT than GO and TO. While STC and STN tended to increase with year for all treatments, NH4+-N and NO3--N contents varied with treatments and years. Sheep grazing enhanced soil C storage, but had a variable effect on N storage and residual N compared to tillage and herbicide application for weed control.","Marta"
5,NA,"not vetted","Management and Tillage Influence Barley Forage Productivity and Water Use in Dryland Cropping Systems","Annual cereal forages are resilient in water use (WU), water use efficiency (WUE), and weed control compared with grain crops in dryland systems. The combined influence of tillage and management systems on annual cereal forage productivity and WU is not well documented. We conducted a field study for the effects of tillage (no-till and tilled) and management (ecological and conventional) systems on WU and performance of forage barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and weed biomass in two crop rotations (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.]-forage barley-pea [Pisum sativum L.] and wheat-forage barley-corn [Zea mays L.] -pea) from 2004 to 2010 in eastern Montana. Conventional management included recommended seeding rates, broadcast N fertilization, and short stubble height of wheat. Ecological management included 33% greater seeding rates, banded N fertilization at planting, and taller wheat stubble. Forage barley in ecological management had 28 more plants m(-2), 2 cm greater height, 65 more tillers m(-2), 606 kg ha(-1) greater crop biomass, 3.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) greater WUE, and 47% reduction in weed biomass at harvest than in conventional management. Pre-plant and post-harvest soil water contents were similar among tillage and management systems, but barley WU was 13 mm greater in 4-yr than 3-yr rotation. Tillage had little effect on barley performance and WU. Dryland forage barley with higher seeding rate and banded N fertilization in more diversified rotation produced more yield and used water more efficiently than that with conventional seeding rate, broadcast N fertilization, and less diversified rotation in the semiarid northern Great Plains.","Marta"
6,NA,"not vetted","Transition cropping system impacts on organic wheat yield and quality","Organic wheat and small grains are produced on relatively few acres in the inland Pacific Northwest. The objective of this study was to examine how the nitrogen (N) dynamics of cropping systems (CSs) produced during the transition phase impacted organic wheat yield and protein levels in the first 2 years of certified organic production. Certified organic spring wheat (SW) was produced in 2006 and winter wheat (WW) in 2007 following nine, 3-year transitional cereal, small grain and legume-intensive CSs. SW and WW following perennial alfalfa + oat/pea forage or 3 years of legume green manure tended to be more productive than wheat that followed systems that contained a small grain crop for at least 1 year during the transition. In addition to increasing soil N, well-established stands of forage and green manure provided adequate cover to reduce weed establishment prior to organic production. Effective weed control strategies were as important as increasing soil inorganic N levels for improving organic wheat production. Choice of crop type, cultivar and rotation is important in organic wheat systems and in this study, WW had better stand establishment, competition with weeds and higher overall yield than SW and would be a better-suited class of wheat for organic production in situations where spring weeds are the dominant problem. Regardless of CS or crop type, supplemental soil fertility (primarily N) during the organic production phase will be necessary to maintain high soil N levels and wheat yields in these dryland systems.","Marta"

Field experiments investigatedweed suppression potential of spring-planted CCs and their effects on plant available water, crop yields, and net returns. The CC treatments were implemented during the fallow phase of NT wheat (Triticum aestivum L)-sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench)-fallow rotation at two locations: Brownell and Colby, over 3 yr in western Kansas. Treatments were oat-triticale (OT), oat-triticale-pea (Pisum sativum; OTP), spring pea, and fallow. Spring pea aboveground biomass was 3,290 kg ha-1, whereas OT produced 5,640 kg ha- 1 and OTP produced 5,260 kg ha-1. Regardless of location, weed biomass was reduced between 86 and 99% with CCs relative to weedy fallow. Cover crops reduced plant available water at winter wheat planting in three out of the six site-years. Averaged across years, CCs reduced winter wheat yields by 18% compared with fallow at Brownell but not at Colby. Replacing fallow with spring pea increased gross revenue but generated negative net returns because of high cost of herbicide and pea seed. Net return with OT or OTP CCs were negative in four out of six site-years when used strictly for weed suppression. However, net returns were mostly positive when OT ($110-876) or OTP (-$ 110-832) CCs were used as forage. Our results showed replacing fallow with spring-planted CCs for weed suppression in dryland cropping system is profitable only when the CCs are used for forage.","Marta"
9,NA,"not vetted","Is Pasture Cropping a Valid Weed Management Tool?","The aim of the present work was to study the feasibility of pasture cropping under the Mediterranean conditions prevailing in central Spain and its potential as a weed management tool. Three cropping systems were assessed: conventionally grown winter barley and winter barley in pasture cropping with two perennial summer species, Cynodon dactylon and Eragrostis curvula. The results showed that the growth of these two species in a pasture cropping system was limited by the severe drought conditions and high temperatures present during the summer in some of the study years. Although there were no differences in the establishment of winter barley in any of the treatments assessed, pasture cropping reduced winter barley yields up to 50%-60% in years with low rainfall in spring. Regarding weed control, pasture cropping showed a significant suppression of the total weed density and number of weed species. As a conclusion, pasture cropping can be considered as a valid weed management tool. However, the economic feasibility of this system under the climatic conditions of central Spain (characterized by a high risk of severe summer droughts) is still not clear. The availability of supplemental irrigation may reduce competition between pastures and winter crops and ensure a profitable production of summer pastures.","Marta"
10,NA,"not vetted","Economical Evaluation of Reduced Herbicide Doses Application Rates to Control Phalaris brachystachys (Short-Spiked Canary Grass) in a Biennial Wheat-Sunflower Rotation in Mediterranean Dryland: A Modelling Approach","Phalaris brachystachys (short-spiked canary grass) is considered to be among the most troublesome cereal weeds in Mediterranean areas. A bioeconomic model, based on population dynamics, competition and economic sub-models, was developed to simulate the long-term economic consequence of using herbicide-based strategies: no herbicide application, full herbicide dose (standard rate) and two reduced dose rates (75 and 50% of the standard rate) to control P. brachystachys in a biennial wheat-sunflower rotation. Simulation results indicated that only herbicide application at a full dose (90% control) and 3/4 dose (80% control) produced positive economic results, with the full dose being the best strategy (EUR 98.65 ha(-1) year(-1)). A sensitivity analysis showed that the economic outcome, in terms of annualized net return, was strongly influenced by changes in yield, price, and fixed costs. In addition, the annualized net return was more sensitive to parameter changes at reduced herbicide doses than at full rate. In the wheat-sunflower rotation system, the application of the full dose of herbicide was the most economical and stable strategy in the long-term. Reduced doses are not a recommended option from an economic point of view. Bioeconomic models provide practical insight into different management approaches for effective weed control.","Marta"
11,NA,"not vetted","Competitive ability of rotational crops with weeds in dryland organic wheat production systems","While demand continues to grow and prices for organic grains have remained almost double those of conventional grains, few growers in the dryland wheat production region of Eastern Washington produce organic grain. Growers have cited weed control constraints as a top factor preventing adoption of organic production practices. In organic systems, inherent competitive ability of crops is very important in managing and preventing weed infestations. The objective of this study was to identify crop species that could reduce weed pressure and compete with perennial weeds in a wheat (Triticum aestivum) rotation. To assess weed suppressive ability of alternative rotational crops, relative total weed biomass and relative biomass of two perennial and three annual weed species were examined over 4 years in three organic cropping systems where winter wheat was in rotation with alternative crops, as part of a long-term study examining dryland organic wheat production. Three years of continuous alfalfa (Medicago sativa) production reduced Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) biomass during the alfalfa production phase, and reduced Canada thistle biomass in winter wheat following alfalfa, compared with wheat following winter pea (Pisum sativum). Alfalfa was competitive with wild oat (Avena fatua), though it competed poorly with winter annual grass weeds. Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare), when established successfully, suppressed jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) more than winter triticale (x Triticosecale), winter wheat, and spring wheat, and demonstrated some competitiveness toward field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis). Winter triticale competed poorly with field bindweed, but suppressed Canada thistle and downy brome (Bromus tectorum). All alternative rotational crops contained lower weed biomass than winter pea, the crop typically rotated with wheat in the region. Organic and conventional growers could gain benefits in perennial and winter annual weed suppression by incorporating alternative rotational crops into wheat rotations.","Marta"
12,NA,"not vetted","Net global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity in organic and conventional wheat-based farming systems","There is a need of information about global warming potential in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based organic and conventional farming systems. We evaluated net global warming potential (NGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in the organic farming system (OFS) using sheep grazing to control weeds without N application and the conventional farming system (CFS) with herbicide, pesticide, and N applications in three crop phases of a 5-yr crop rotation from 2013-2014 to 2015-2016 in the northern Great Plains. Crop phases were winter wheat after lentil (Lens culinaris L.) (W-L), winter wheat after sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) cover crop (W-C), and lentil after winter wheat (L-W) in a 5-yr rotation of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and sweet clover cover crop intercrop-sweet clover cover crop-winter wheat-lentil-winter wheat. Carbon sequestration rate at the 0-to-120-cm depth from 2009 to 2015 was greater in OFS with W-C than other treatments. The CO2 equivalent of N2O + CH4 fluxes was greater in OFS with L-Wthan other treatments, except in CFS with L-W in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. The CO2 equivalent of N fertilization was greater in CFS, but CO2 equivalent of CH4 flux due to enteric fermentation from sheep was greater in OFS. Both NGWP and GHGI were lower in OFS with W-C than other treatments. Organic farming system using sheep grazing to manage weeds in winter wheat following cover crop can reduce NGWP and GHGI compared with CFS with chemical inputs in dryland farming.","Marta"
13,NA,"not vetted","Weed responses to fallow management in Pacific Northwest dryland cropping systems","A two-year rotation of summer fallow (SF)/winter wheat (WW) is the most common cropping system in low precipitation areas of the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). In SF, multiple tillage operations are used to manage weeds and maximize soil water storage and potential WW yield. Reduced tillage fallow (RTF) is an alternative to SF that leaves > 30% of the previous crop's residue on the surface. A four-year (2014-18) field study was conducted to evaluate the influence of SF and RTF on weed species density, cover and composition in dryland WW; determine if changes in these weed infestation attributes have any influence on crop density and yield; and evaluate economic costs of each type of fallow management. The experimental design was randomized complete block with four replications where each phase of SF/WW and RTF/WW rotations was present every year. Individual plots of WW were divided into a weedy sub-plot with no weed control, general area with chemical weed control, and weed-free sub-plot where weeds were manually removed. Infestations of annual grass and other weeds in weedy sub-plots increased throughout the study. Grass weed cover, consisting mainly of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), and total weed cover were significantly lower in WW following RTF than following SF in all years except 2018. Densities of grass and total weeds were similar in both fallow managements indicating that weed plants were larger in WW following SF than following RTF due to earlier or faster emergence. Grass cover differences were not found in general areas likely because of a reduced seedbank. When weeds were present, mean yield of WW was higher following RTF than SF indicating that weeds were less competitive in RTF. Reduced tillage fallow could improve weed management in fallow/WW cropping systems of the PNW compared to SF/WW, particularly if the most problematic species are grasses.","Marta"
14,NA,"not vetted","Evaluating opportunities for an increased role of winter crops as adaptation to climate change in dryland cropping systems of the US Inland Pacific Northwest","The long-term sustainability of wheat-based dryland cropping systems in the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW) of the United States depends on how these systems adapt to climate change. Climate models project warming with slight increases in winter precipitation but drier summers for the IPNW. These conditions combined with elevated atmospheric CO2, which promote crop growth and improve transpiration-use efficiency, may be beneficial for cropping systems in the IPNW and may provide regional opportunities for agricultural diversification and intensification. Crop modeling simulation under future climatic conditions showed increased wheat productivity for the IPNW for most of the century. Water use by winter wheat was projected to decrease significantly in higher and intermediate precipitation zones and increase slightly in drier locations, but with winter crops utilizing significantly more water overall than spring crops. Crop diversification with inclusion of winter crops other than wheat is a possibility depending on agronomic and economic considerations, while substitution of winter for spring crops appeared feasible only in high precipitation areas. Increased weed pressure, higher pest populations, expanded ranges of biotic stressors, and agronomic, plant breeding, economic, technology, and other factors will influence what production systems eventually prevail under future climatic conditions in the region.","Marta"
15,NA,"not vetted","The Effects of Tillage-Induced Soil Disturbance on Weed Infestation of Winter Wheat","The purpose of this work was to investigate whether weed infestation and weed coverage could be managed using less non-inversion soil disturbance. The study was carried out in a degraded chernozem soil in a long-term trial where five ploughless tillage treatments were applied in addition to the mouldboard ploughing treatment: subsoiling, tine tillage (deep and shallow), disk tillage, and direct drilling. In this paper results of weed surveys are evaluated in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) relation, since this crop was grown in six seasons inside of 14 years. Weed surveys were carried out four times in a season using the Balazs-Ujvarosi method, which is based on the ground coverage of the weeds. A high degree of weed coverage was found in the early years of the trial at the ploughless treatments, and particularly at the direct drilling system. During the six years of the wheat, weed coverage significantly decreased in all treatments, and the number of species also dropped from 18 to five. Weed coverage most often decreased in the order: direct drilling > disking > tine tillage (deep) > tine tillage (shallow) > subsoiling > ploughing. We can conclude that the reasons for the decrease in weed coverage were the timing of tillage treatments, the high ratio of cereals in the crop sequence, and the timing of the chemical weed control application, once in the springs and second in cereal stubbles by the end of summer. Although data of grain yields of the winter wheat were supplementary to the evaluation of the changes in weed coverage, they were similarly connected with the tillage-induced soil condition. This study shows the possibility of the weed coverage decrease by the well-adopted soil tillage, including ploughless systems.","Marta"
16,NA,"not vetted","Scouringrush (Equisetum spp.) control in dryland winter wheat","The adoption of chemical fallow rotations in Pacific Northwest dryland winter wheat production has caused a weed species composition shift in which scouringrush has established in production fields. Thus, there has been interest in identifying herbicides that effectively control scouringrush in winter wheat-chemical fallow cropping systems. Field experiments were established in growers' fields near Reardan, WA, in 2014, and The Dalles, OR, in 2015. Ten herbicide treatments were applied to mowed and nonmowed plots during chemical fallow rotations. Scouringrush stem densities were quantified the following spring and after wheat harvest at both locations. Chlorsulfuron plus MCPA-ester resulted in nearly 100% control of scouringrush through wheat harvest. Before herbicide application, mowing had no effect on herbicide efficacy. We conclude chlorsulfuron plus MCPA-ester is a commercially acceptable treatment for smooth and intermediate scouringrush control in winter wheat-chemical fallow cropping systems; however, the lack of a positive yield response when scouringrushes were controlled should factor into management decisions.","Marta"
17,NA,"not vetted","Effects of crop mixtures on rust development on faba bean grown in Mediterranean climates","Faba bean (Vicia faba) is a temperate grain legume of major importance in Mediterranean agriculture. Faba bean production can be severely constrained in the area by rust incited by Uromyces viciae-fabae. Control with fungicides is possible, but there is a growing interest on alternative control methods, compatible with organic agriculture. Intercropping faba bean with cereals has been suggested as an alternative to maximize land use and increase crop resilience, with potential beneficial effects reducing weeds and diseases. In the present work, we studied the effect of intercropping faba bean with barley, triticale or wheat on faba bean rust development. Field studies performed over two consecutive seasons in two different countries showed that faba bean rust is significantly reduced when faba bean is intercropped with cereals confirming the value of faba bean-cereal intercropping for the management of faba bean rust. These results confirm that, under our conditions, intercropping faba bean with cereals (oat, barley, wheat or triticale) could usefully contribute to the management of faba bean rust.","Marta"
18,NA,"not vetted","Cover crops to improve soil health in the North American Great Plains","Rotating cereal crops (e.g., wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] with a 10- to 21-mo summer fallow period [fallow]) is a common farming practice in dryland (rainfed) agricultural regions. Fallow is associated with several challenges including low precipitation storage efficiency, depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC), loss of soil fertility, little crop residue retention and soil erosion, and few control options for herbicide-resistant (HR) weeds. The inability to effectively control HR weeds poses a major challenge to maintaining soil and water conservation practices such as no-tillage, as some producers are considering tillage to control weeds. Cover crop (CC) integration into wheat-based production systems to replace portions of the fallow period provides an opportunity to increase SOC, improve soil fertility, suppress weeds, and increase profitability of dryland crop production, especially when CCs are used as forage. This forum paper used the North American Great Plains as a model region to review information on (a) challenges of dryland agriculture; (b) integrating CCs in dryland agriculture; (c) benefits, challenges, and limitations of CCs in dryland crop production; (d) management options for CC integration in dryland grain systems; and (e) recommendations for future research efforts.","Marta"

It is an annual broad leaf weed, which is indigenous throughout most parts of the globe and one of the most competitive weeds of spring cereal crops. In southern Russia it is emerging as an important crop competitor. Field trials focusing on herbicide timing and efficacy on wild mustard control and spring wheat yield in the Moscow region, Kashira and Baribino districts. A PRE glyphosate application to wheat regardless of fall or spring application timing favorably suppressed wild mustard in 2018. Weeds were not controlled in 2019 with the earliest application timings of glyphosate because weeds emerged late. In comparing fall and spring application timings, the formulated combination of (iodosulfuron/mesosulfuron/antidote mefenpyr-diethyl) at both field rates provided 80% weed control for all application timings and locations, and also resulting in the greatest spring wheat grain yield. Overall, herbicide treatments performed greater when they were in the fall than during the spring. Based on POST herbicide application, tribenuron-methyl provided the greatest wild mustard suppression (75%) and also caused the highest reduction in wild mustard biomass (3.3 g), stem number (6), seed number (880) and germination percentage (33%). When wild mustard was approximately 32 weeds/m(2) causedtotal wheat yield loss.","Marta"
20,NA,"not vetted","Growth and development of spring crops in competition with oat in the dryland Mediterranean climate of eastern Washington","Weed management during spring crop production in eastern Washington presents many challenges. Many spring crops are weak competitors with weeds. In May of 2010 and 2011, two spring crop trials were initiated near Pullman, WA, to compare the relative competitiveness of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), and pea (Pisum sativum L.) using cultivated oat (Avena sativa L.) as a surrogate for wild oat (Avena fatua L.) competition. The experiment was arranged as a split-block split-plot design with four replications. One set of main plots included three oat density treatments (0, 63, and 127 plants m(-2)), while a second set included each crop species. Crop species main plots were then split into subplots of two different seeding rates (recommended and doubled). Crop populations decreased as oat density increased and increased as crop seeding rate increased. As oat density increased, preharvest crop biomass decreased for all crops, while oat biomass and yield increased. Oat biomass and yield were greater in legume plots compared with cereal plots. Increasing oat density decreased yields for all crops, whereas doubling crop seeding rate increased yields for barley and wheat in 2010 and barley in 2011. Compared with legumes, cereals were taller, produced more biomass, and were more competitive with oat.","Marta"
21,NA,"not vetted","Challenges and Responses to Ongoing and Projected Climate Change for Dryland Cereal Production Systems throughout the World","Since the introduction of mechanized production in both developed and developing countries, crops and their management have undergone significant adaptation resulting in increased productivity. Historical yield increases in wheat have occurred across most regions of the world (20-88 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), but climate trends threaten to dampen or reverse these gains such that yields are expected to decrease by 5-6% despite rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Current and projected climatic factors are temporally and spatially variable in dryland cereal production systems throughout the world. Productivity gains in wheat in some locations have been achieved from traditional agronomic practices and breeding. Continued improvement in all cereal production regions and locations of the world requires technical advances, including closer monitoring of soils, water conservation strategies, and multiple sowing times using different crops to reduce risks. The management of disease, pests, and weeds will be an added challenge, especially in areas of higher precipitation. Excellent progress has been achieved in Asia and there is much potential in Sub-Saharan Africa. Technical solutions seem within our grasp but must be implemented in the context of variable social, economic, regulatory, and administrative constraints, providing opportunities for cross fertilization and global collaboration to meet them.","Marta"

Cropping systems include tilled and no-till wheat-fallow, wheat-soybean, and wheat-sorghum rotations. Net returns from systems are compared under different levels of weed pressure. Producers operating over longer planning horizons would choose to double-crop regardless of the tillage method used and weed pressure level. Producers operating under shorter planning horizons would implement wheat-fallow systems when weed pressure is high and double crop when weed pressure is low.","Marta"

A mathematical model for simulating the dynamics of a weed community composed of populations of Lolium rigidum and Avena sterilis growing in winter wheat under a Mediterranean climate has been constructed using previous reported data on demographic rates. The model was used to simulate the population long-term dynamics and the effect of eight herbicide-based control strategies. In absence of herbicide application, our model predicts that A. sterilis seed bank increases steadily up to an equilibrium density of 2567 seeds m(-2) whereas L. rigidum is driven to extinction after a period of 9years. The most effective strategy in terms of reducing weed abundance in the long-term was the application of full dose of herbicide controlling L. rigidum and half-dose of herbicide controlling A. sterilis, which resulted in an equilibrium level of 25 seeds m(-2) for L. rigidum and extinction of A. sterilis. A sensitivity analysis showed that the demographic process to which the model was more sensitive was seed rain loss in both species. Furthermore, control tactics specifically focusing on these demographic parameters should be investigated.","Marta"

The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of three long-term tillage intensities; conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-till (NT), on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) yield, available soil water (ASW), and water productivity. The study was conducted near Tribune, KS, from 1991 through 2015 in a wheat-sorghum-fallow (WSF) rotation. The CT plots were tilled (primarily with a sweep plow), on average, four to five times per fallow season; NT plots used herbicides for weed control during fallow. The RT plots used a combination of herbicides and tillage for weed control during fallow prior to both crops for years 1991 to 2000; and, for the years 2001 to 2015, the RT system was NT before sorghum planting (short-term NT) and CT before wheat planting. On average, there was a 31% wheat yield advantage for NT over CT, 16% NT over RT, and 12% RT over CT. On average, there was a 120% sorghum yield advantage for NT over CT, 41% NT over RT, and 55% RT over CT. Sorghum yields were 80% greater for continuous NT compared with short-term NT (2001-2015 RT). The average of profile ASW at planting was less for CT compared with NT and RT. There was a significant yield and water productivity benefit in the order NT > RT > CT for both crops, but greater for sorghum than wheat.","Marta"

We hypothesis that integration of alternative GA-responsive dwarfing genes into elite wheat cultivars can promote early vigor and weed-competitiveness under Mediterranean climate. We develop near-isogenic lines of bread wheat cultivars with GAR dwarfing genes and evaluate them for early vigor and weed-competitiveness under various environmental and management conditions to identify promising NIL for weed-competitiveness and grain yield. While all seven NILs responded to external gibberellic acid application, they exhibited differences in early vigor. Greenhouse and field evaluations highlighted NIL OC1 (Rht8andRht12) as a promising line, with significant advantage in canopy early vigor over its parental. To facilitate accurate and continuous early vigor data collection, we applied non-destructive image-based phenotyping approaches which offers non-expensive and end-user friendly solution for selection. NIL OC1 was tested under different weed density level, infestation waves, and temperatures and highlight the complex genotypic x environmental x management interactions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of genetic modification of dwarfing genes as promising approach to improve weed-competitiveness, and serve as basis for future breeding efforts to support sustainable wheat production under semi-arid Mediterranean climate.","Marta"
26,NA,"not vetted","Comparison of water-saving potential of fallow and crop change with high water-use winter-wheat - summer-maize rotation","A land fallow system (LFS) designed to adjust the winter-wheat - summer-maize cropping system to fallow - summer-maize was introduced in Hebei Province to alleviate groundwater depletion in the region. However, some of the water saved was lost through evaporation from bare soil and transpiration by weeds. So far, no measurement has been done in the region to address this non-productive water loss, thereby limiting the water-saving potential of the introduced LFS. Furthermore, the reduction in crop production under the summer-maize - fallow system threatens food security. The objective of this study was to determine which practice is effective to keep soil water during fallow and the exact water-saving potential of different cropping system in the region. Firstly, field experiments were conducted under various soil surface management systems - including plastic mulching (PM), straw mulching (SM), shallow tillage (ST) and weed control (WC). The effects of saving water, controlling weeds and managing nutrients were analyzed under the various surface soil management methods. The results showed that compared with the control (no soil surface management, CK), 177, 64.7, 71.0 and 25.0 mm of water was saved respectively under PM, SM, WC and ST surface soil management methods in 2019-2020. The effect of weed control decreased in the order of PM > WC > SM > ST. While PM significantly increased soil nutrient in all the treatments, the others showed slight but insignificant increases. Secondly, the precise water-use of each of the cropping systems was determined using large lysimeters. The analysis showed that compared with the wheat-maize system, 60-100 mm of water was saved under alternating wheat-soybean, wheat-millet, mung bean - fresh edible maize, spring sweet potato cropping systems. The results were key for technical guide in developing future cultivation adjustment policies.","Marta"

The productivity of landraces under high-input and optimal conditions is usually lower than modern wheat varieties. The present study compared the response of Sicilian wheat landraces and modern varieties to organic management, including organic fertilization, and conventional management, including mineral fertilization and chemical weed control, under rainfed condition and supplementary irrigation in a field trial conducted on a xerofluvent soil in a semiarid Mediterranean climate. Modern varieties were on average more productive than landraces, although certain landraces achieved comparable yields, in particular under organic management. The increase in grain yield under conventional management in comparison with the organic management was higher for modern varieties than landraces. The loss of productivity in rainfed conditions was lower for landraces compared to modern varieties. The grain quality traits were similar between landraces and modern varieties and in both cases the conventional management led to an improvement of the traits. These findings highlight the resilience and adaptability of traditional wheat landraces to low-input agricultural systems and offer valuable insights into improving the sustainability and productivity of wheat production in Mediterranean environments.","Marta"
28,NA,"not vetted","Climate and tillage system drive weed communities' functional diversity in a Mediterranean cereal-legume rotation","The first step to develop an environmentally sound weed management is to know how weed communities respond to environmental drivers. Among these, climate and management practices are probably the more determinant factors for annual plants community assembly. In this framework, a trait based approach may be useful to assess weed community responses and the processes behind them. Here, we focused on three non-inversion tillage practices which differently affect soil conditions and the vertical distribution of weed seeds. We also took into account the climate variability across years. We specifically asked whether the type of non-inversion tillage system and the annual variability in climatic conditions explain the differences in the functional structure of weed communities. To assess this question we conducted a nine yearlong field experiment in which three non-inversion tillage systems were compared: subsoil tillage, minimum tillage and no-tillage. We characterized the functional structure of weed communities by first obtaining data on three resource acquisition traits (specific leaf area, plant height and growth habit) and five regenerative traits (seed weight, longevity index, dispersal structures, seed cover and emergence time). Then, we computed the community weighted mean (CWM) and the mean pairwise distance (MPD) of each trait as well as a multi trait MPD index. Climate annual conditions were characterized based on autumn-winter precipitation, average temperature and number of frost days. We found that tillage systems and climatic factors mainly sorted weed species according to their emergence time and seed weight. Weed communities from no-tillage plots were characterized by having an earlier emergence and seeds without pericarp. Regarding climatic conditions, we found that warmer and rainier autumn-winter conditions were related to lower functional diversity of regenerative traits and higher diversity in terms of resource acquisition traits. Our results highlight that factors affecting seedling emergence as well as traits related to these processes are critical during weed community assemblage. Our results also showed that none of the compared tillage systems was clearly outstanding in terms of functional diversity, but that each system benefited certain functional design. Furthermore, the relative importance of these management practices to drive weed functional structure was clearly lower than the effects of climatic inter-annual fluctuations.","Marta"

A 6-year rainfed cropping systems experiment was conducted near Ritzville, Washington USA from 2015 to 2021. The objective was to compare performance of winter and spring canola, winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) (WT), and winter wheat (WW) and measure their effects on soil water dynamics and subsequent performance of spring wheat (SW). Overwinter soil water gain in canola stubble was significantly reduced compared to water gain in WT and WW stubble. The more winter precipitation, the greater the differences in soil water among treatments in early spring. There was a trend in all years for diminished overwinter soil water gain in canola stubble. Averaged over years, grain yield of SW was 1940, 2340, and 2210 kg/ha grown on canola, WT, and WW stubble, respectively (p = 0.045). Coefficients of determination from regression analysis conducted each year showed a high correlation between water content in the 180 cm profile in early spring and SW grain yield, except in one year of extreme drought. This paper provides a first report in a Mediterranean climate region of decline in wheat grain yield after canola versus after a cereal crops, primarily due to reduced overwinter soil water storage.","Marta"

The objectives of this study were to (1) spatially characterize the population dynamics of predominant weed species and apply this information into quantifying the effect of treated and untreated weed infestations on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields and (2) evaluate potential herbicide savings with post-harvest site-specific treatments. Multi-year grain yield and weed data were acquired at harvest in each of four years (2015-18) within a dryland production field (9.2 ha) in eastern Oregon. Abundance of weed species (2015) and percent cover of weed species (2016, 2017 and 2018) were visually estimated on a square grid based on dividing the field into 7-m(2) cells. Spatial patterns in the weed community were subject to rapid change and depended on year, crop and weed control strategy. While tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum) was the most predominant and competitive species, the spatial distribution of this weed and that of other species varied each year. Tumble mustard and prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola) were equally problematic in spring wheat and winter wheat whereas Russian thistle (Salsola tragus) was problematic in spring wheat and downy brome (Bromus tectorum) in winter wheat. Potential savings from site-specific herbicide application varied from 10 to 95% based on percentage of field infested. Weed maps at harvest are useful for studying weed dynamics, identifying potentially herbicide-resistant weeds and planning site-specific weed management. Combined with yield maps, weed maps at harvest are also useful for explaining crop yield variability that is associated with weed competition and weed control in furtherance of integrated weed management strategies.","Marta"
31,NA,"not vetted","Reduced crop sowing density improves performance of rare arable weed species more effectively than reduced fertilisation","Characteristic arable weed species of dryland cereal fields have undergone significant declines, due to agricultural intensification, to the point that some of them are considered rare. Crop edges host higher abundances of arable weed species, therefore they may act as a refuge for the conservation of these rare arable species. Using mesocosms, we experimentally tested how conditions at field edges (i.e. lower sowing densities and less intensive fertiliser applications) operate on the growth (biomass and height) and reproduction (reproductive biomass and flower onset) of six rare arable species. We found the rare arable species achieved lower biomass when growing with wheat compared with growing alone, and biomass of most of species was lower under high wheat sowing density than under low sowing density. In contrast, fertiliser application affected only two of the six arable species tested, especially when they were growing alone. Although the time to flowering was not affected by the conditions tested, reproductive biomass showed the same trends as overall biomass. These results indicate that conservation of rare arable species must primarily consider reductions in crop competition to increase their biomass and reproductive ability.","Marta"
32,NA,"not vetted","Management of pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) in grain sorghum with integrated strategies","Pigweed is difficult to manage in grain sorghum because of widespread herbicide resistance, a limited number of registered effective herbicides, and the synchronous emergence of pigweed with grain sorghum in Kansas. The combination of cultural and mechanical control tactics with an herbicide program are commonly recognized as best management strategies; however, limited information is available to adapt these strategies to dryland systems. Our objective for this research was to assess the influence of four components, including a winter wheat cover crop (CC), row-crop cultivation, three row widths, with and without a herbicide program, on pigweed control in a dryland system. Field trials were implemented during 2017 and 2018 at three locations for a total of 6 site-years. The herbicide program component resulted in excellent control (>97%) in all treatments at 3 and 8 weeks after planting (WAP). CC provided approximately 50% reductions in pigweed density and biomass for both timings in half of the site-years; however, mixed results were observed in the remaining site-years, ranging from no attributable difference to a 170% increase in weed density at 8 WAP in 1 site-year. Treatments including row-crop cultivation reduced pigweed biomass and density in most site-years 3 and 8 WAP. An herbicide program is required to achieve pigweed control and should be integrated with row-crop cultivation or narrow row widths to reduce the risk of herbicide resistance. Additional research is required to optimize the use of CC as an integrated pigweed management strategy in dryland grain sorghum.","Marta"
33,NA,"not vetted","Soil and crop management systems that ameliorate damage caused by decades of dryland agroecosystem mismanagement","Sustainable crop production in the Great Plains of North America has been challenging since early settlement times, and mismanagement has severely damaged our dryland agroecosystems. The unintentional damage stemmed from using practices unsuited to dryer climates. In fact, the management practices imported from more humid agricultural areas during the settlement period were considered the best ways to farm. The Dust Bowl era was the disastrous result of creating bare soil surfaces, with aggregates pulverized by excessive tillage on millions of hectares of land. It became obvious to pioneer scientists that retaining cover on the soil surface was critical to sustainability and their early efforts resulted in a widely adopted practice known as stubble mulch. Stubble mulch practices markedly decreased the rate of damage to dryland ecosystems. Advent of herbicidal weed control led to reduced and no-till practices that not only increased soil cover, but also significantly enhanced soil water conservation. This paper focuses on how and why the coupling of conservation tillage and cropping intensification is ameliorating the damage that accrued over decades of agroecosystem mismanagement. The objectives of this paper are to (a) remind us of fragile nature of the Great Plains ecosystem, (b) review how and why ecosystems were degraded, and (c) identify principles and associated practices for amelioration.","Marta"

Organic management is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional agriculture, and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a potential new crop for organic systems in the Pacific Northwest. Here we tested the agronomic and economic effects of diversifying dryland crop rotations with organic quinoa in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest. Eight 3-year grain cropping sequences were compared based on metrics of crop productivity, crop quality, and economic performance. While the crop sequences affected these metrics, crop yields and quality were mediated primarily by weather across growing seasons. Cumulative yields were higher for crop sequences that started with chickpea compared to barley. Organic quinoa yields were lower than the yield potential for the region, but some 3-year sequences with quinoa produced similar net returns to some sequences with wheat. Mean returns over variable costs were $324 ha(-1) yr(-1) for the 3-year sequence treatments; each treatment averaged positive net returns to variable costs despite some individual years having negative returns. The highest net returns to variable costs were in sequences that grew wheat and those that started with chickpea. Returns over total costs for the 3-year sequence treatments averaged -$33 ha(-1) yr(-1). The organic cropping systems (the total 8-year crop rotations including 5 years of organic alfalfa) produced higher returns over variable and total costs ($615 ha(-1) yr(-1) and $168 ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) than a typical conventional rotation with county average yields during the same 8-year period ($477 ha(-1) yr(-1) and $82 ha(-1) yr(-1)). Our results show that premiums for organic alfalfa and grains make these organic cropping systems economically viable for dryland production in the Pacific Northwest. Advances in organic weed control and regionally adapted quinoa varieties would further reduce the risk for farmers attempting this cropping system diversification.","Marta"

Improving crop water use efficiency (WUE) will help to safeguard the environmental sustainability of food production in dryland areas. However, the impact of drought on crop WUE varies-a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of relevant factors is needed to support evidence-based management decisions. Here, we used a meta-analysis of global drylands (81 studies with 836 paired observations) to evaluate the response of various crop WUEs to drought based on various natural and human induced factors. Our results showed that responses of crop types' WUE varied under drought intensity, which probably a reference for crop selection in drylands. Cotton could be one of crop selection reference in hyper-arid or arid regions, and legume is not recommended for drylands without irrigation. Cereal crop are suitable for growing in semi-arid or dry sub-humid areas. Moreover, soil improvement and fertilizer management are the effective methods to alleviate drought stress, in addition to irrigation. Soil with medium-texture, 1.3-1.4 g cm(-3) bulk density and 15-20 g kg(-1) organic matter is beneficial for improving WUE under drought. Fertilizer should be carefully considered and not exceed 200 kg ha(-1) for wheat in drylands. Water deficit can improve crop WUE, but should not exceed 40% of the full irrigation amount. Field management practices, such as mulching and weed control, can help alleviate drought by regulating WUE to some extent. This study evaluated the responses of various crop WUEs to drought and highlighted the factors contributing to and/or decreasing crop WUE from natural factor and management practices, which provides a basis for agricultural drought mitigation strategies under future climate change in dryland areas.","Marta"

We evaluated the effect of tillage and crop management intensity on the growth, yield, and water use of dryland corn from 2005 to 2010 in the northern Great Plains. Tillage systems (no-tillage, NT, and conventional tillage, CT) as main-plot and crop management to corn (traditional intensity: conventional seeding rates and reduced wheat, Triticum aestivum L., stubble height; and improved intensity: increased seeding rate for 3 out of 6 yr and wheat stubble height) as split-plot treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Corn plant stand was greater for CT than NT in 3 out of 6 yr and greater for the improved than the traditional intensity in 3 out of 3 yr. Seed number and grain yield were greater for NT than CT in 4 out of 6 yr. Biomass was greater for NT than CT in 1 out of 6 yr and greater for NT than CT in the traditional intensity. Corn plant height, seed weight, and harvest index as well as preplant and postharvest soil water, water use, and water-use efficiency were not influenced by treatments, but varied with years. Corn yield increased for NT compared with CT during years with below-average precipitation due to increased seed number and by reducing seeding rate and wheat stubble height. No-tillage with reduced seeding rate and wheat stubble height can enhance dryland corn production without affecting soil water.","Marta"
37,NA,"not vetted","Utilisation of cover crops: implications for conservation agriculture systems in a mediterranean climate region of South Africa","Purpose Cover crops can provide multiple agroecosystem services to crops produced in conservation agriculture systems. South African grain producers in the Mediterranean climate region are reluctant to integrate cover crops in rainfed systems since cover crops replace cash crops leading to financial losses. Using cover crops as fodder can help cover input costs, while providing a range of advantageous services to the cropping system. The aim of this study was to investigate how cover crop mixtures and the utilisation of cover crops affect soil quality, the quality and quantity of the mulch as well as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) produced in the subsequent year. Methods A two-year study was conducted in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. In Year 1, diverse legume and cereal-based cover crop mixtures were partially grazed, cut and material removed for haymaking, or left unutilised as a mulch. In Year 2, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was planted to investigate the effects of cover crop mixtures and utilisation method on subsequent spring wheat yield. Results Cover crops used as hay or for grazing did not affect (P < 0.05) grain yield of wheat that followed in rotation. Legume-based cover crop mixtures increased (P < 0.05) wheat grain protein content regardless of utilisation method. Soil quality and nitrogen content improved (P < 0.05) when cover crops were grazed. Conclusions Cover cropping can be used by South African grain producers as an important agronomic tactic to improve system productivity and support sustainable intensification of rainfed cropping systems.","Marta"

Our objective was to determine the crop yield and soil quality as affected by a transition from grass to dryland organic agriculture in the Central Great Plains of North America. This study evaluated three beef feedlot compost (BFC) treatments in 2010-2015 following biennial application rates: 0 (control), 22.9, and 108.7 t ha(-1) on two dryland organic cropping systems: a wheat (Triticum aestivum)-fallow (WF) rotation harvested for grain and a triticale (Triticosecale)/pea (Pisum sativum)fallow (T/P-F) rotation harvested for forage. The triticale + pea biomass responded positively to the 108.7-t ha(-1) BFC treatment, but not the 22.9-t ha(-1) BFC treatment. The wheat biomass was not affected by BFC addition, but biomass N content increased. Beef feedlot compost input did not increase wheat grain yields, but had a positive effect on wheat grain Zn content. Soil total C and N contents increased with the rate of 108.7 t ha(-1) BFC after three applications, but not with 22.9 t ha(-1) BFC. Soil enzyme activities associated with N and C cycling responded positively to the 108.7-t ha(-1) BFC treatment. Saturated salts were high in the soil receiving 108.7 t ha(-1) of BFC, but did not affect crop yields. These results showed that BFC was effective in enhancing forage yields, wheat grain quality, and soil C and N, as well as specific microbial enzymes important for nutrient cycling. However, the large rates of BFC necessary to elicit these positive responses did not increase grain yields, and resulted in an excessive buildup of soil P.","Marta"

However, the magnitude of this effect can vary with environmental conditions, agricultural management practices and legume genotypes. We aimed to measure the N supply and pre-crop benefits from pulses introduced in different crop rotations with cereals in a Mediterranean climate. Two three-year field trials were set with non N-fertilized fodder triticale (x Triticosecale 'Alter') as a monoculture, and in rotation with irrigated cowpea (Vigna unguiculata' Fradel') as replacement of summer fallow, or rainfed faba bean (Vicia faba 'Favel') or pea (Pisan sativum 'Grisel')as 'break' crops. Two legume residue managements were tested: incorporation into the soil and removal from the system. Triticale monocultures with three levels of synthetic N fertilization were included for estimation of N-fertilizer equivalence from rainfed pulse pre-crops. Yields and N contents were measured for each plant fraction and crop, including weeds. Biologically fixed N was estimated by an N-difference method and residual fixed N (RFN) was calculated. Cowpea fixed between 62-127 kg N ha(-1) and provided up to 61 kg N ha(-1) to soil as RFN. Faba bean and pea fixed between 0-72 kg N ha(-1) but RFN was negative overall, as low as - 52 kg N ha(-1). However, the apparent N benefit of these `break' crops was largely positive (up to 70 kg N ha(-1)) in comparison with the reference crop (triticale). Agricultural intensification with irrigated cowpea did not affect the productivity of subsequent cereal, likely due to a combined effect of low residue mineralization potential of its residues, and to increased nitrate leaching and weed infestation in cereal. However, the overall productivity of the agroecosystem was increased with minimal inputs. Rainfed faba bean and pea improved cereal productivity similarly, but only when grown in wet conditions with no weed control (30-59% yield increase, equivalent to 72-153 kg fertilizer-N ha(-1)). Removal of legume residue did not affect the productivity of subsequent cereal. This study identifies cowpea as a suitable crop for sustainable intensification in Mediterranean conditions.","Marta"

This study examined strategic tillage (ST) to control HR weeds and improve crop yields in an otherwise long-term NT cropping system. Treatments were three crop rotations: (1) continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (WW); (2) wheat-fallow (WF); and (3) wheat-grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.)-fallow (WSF); as main plots. Subplots were reduced tillage (RT), continuous NT, and ST of NT. Results showed ST and RT treatments provided significant control of HR weeds. Soil water content at wheat planting was significantly less with RT compared to NT or ST. Strategic tillage did not affect wheat or grain sorghum yields, but RT decreased sorghum yields by 15% compared to NT. Increasing cropping intensity reduced wheat yields. Strategic tillage reduced bulk density and had no effect on aggregate size distribution or mean weight diameter (MWD) compared to NT though RT reduced the proportion of large macroaggregates and MWD. Similarly, ST compared to NT had no effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) or nitrogen (N) concentrations. Soil phosphorus (P) was not different among the tillage treatments though RT increased potassium (K) concentration near the soil surface. The SOC, MWD, and micronutrient availability were greatest with WW though it had significantly lower pH and K concentration. Our results suggest ST could provide a mitigation option for HR weeds in NT systems with little impact on crop yields and soil properties.","Marta"

This article reports data relative to weed seedbank structure after 18years of continuous application of conventional tillage (CT, based on mouldboard ploughing) or no tillage (NT) within three crop sequences (continuous wheat, W-W; wheat-faba bean, W-F; and wheat-berseem clover, W-B). Tillage system did not affect the size of the total weed seedbank, but altered both its composition and the distribution of seeds within the soil profile. In particular, the adoption of CT favoured some species (mainly Polygonum aviculare), whereas the continuous use of NT favoured other species (Papaver rhoeas, Phalaris spp. and Lactuca serriola). The effects of tillage system on weed seedbank size and composition were less pronounced in the W-B cropping system than in either the W-W or W-F. Compared with W-F and W-B, W-W resulted in an increase in total weed seedbank density (about 16000 seedlings m(-2) in W-W, compared with 10000 and 6000 seedlings m(-2) in W-F and W-B, respectively) and a reduction in weed diversity, with a strong increase in some species (e.g. Polygonum aviculare). Our results for the effect of NT application on weed seedbank size and composition suggest that farmers should only apply such a conservative technique within an appropriate crop sequence.","Marta"

Ecologically based nutrient and weed management the use of ecological processes to replace external chemical inputs may represent a strategy to support crop growth while achieving positive environmental and economic outcomes. In dryland agroecosys-tems around the world, farmers are increasingly transitioning toward no-till and intensified cropping systems, in which unvegetated fallow periods are replaced with crops. This study seeks to determine if cropping system intensification represents an ecologically based strategy for managing nutrients and weeds relative to traditional crop-fallow systems, and to understand the implications for crop production and profitability. We quantified total and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (N), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization of wheat roots and implications for plant phosphorus (P) uptake, 6 years of crop yields, fertilizer and herbicide use, and net operating income across dryland, no-till cropping systems in the semi-arid High Plains, USA. Three levels of cropping system intensity were represented ranging from wheat-fallow (tmvegetated fallow every other year) to continuous cropping (no fallow years). After accounting for variability due to environment and site characteristics, total and potentially mineralizable N were 12% and 30% greater in continuous rotations relative to wheat fallow, respectively. Mid-intensity (fallow every 2 or 3 years) and continuous rotations had roughly 2 and 3 times more AMF colonization than wheat-fallow, respectively, and AMF colonization was positively correlated with wheat plant P concentration. Farmers practicing continuous cropping applied 22 and 34 kg ha(-1) less N fertilizer per crop compared to wheat-fallow and mid-intensity, respectively, despite similar and 60% greater annualized crop production than mid-intensity and wheat-fallow rotations, respectively. Additionally, farmers who practiced continuous cropping used less than half the total herbicide used by wheat-fallow farmers. Net operating incomes of continuous and mid-intensity rotations were an estimated 47 USD ha-(1) yr(-1) (80%) and 42 USD ha(-1) yr(-1) (70%) more than wheat-fallow, respectively. These results suggest that cropping system intensification, and especially continuous cropping, represents an opportunity to achieve more grain production while managing weeds and nutrients with fewer agri-chemical inputs, leading to greater profitability and improved environmental outcomes in no-till agroecosystems.","Marta"

For that we monitored plant and soil microbial diversity during 4 years including all stages of the rotation cycle.The structure and composition of plant and soil communities during wheat crop were different from those found in the fallow years, although the effect of wheat crop on soil bacteria was still noticeable in the 1st year of fallow. The main changes in the structure of microbial communities happened between the first and second year of fallow, probably due to changes in the quality and quantity of litter inputs. As expected, we observed an overall decrease in plant diversity in the wheat stage. Fallows had a positive effect on plant species diversity by allowing the maintenance of a seed bank and controlling the simplification of weed communities. However, the impact of fallow on microbial communities is more complex: bacterial diversity was higher during the wheat stage while fungal diversity was either higher or unchanged.These results suggest that the rotation stage is the main driver of the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities, probably through changes in the plant community that deserve further examination. Inter-annual fluctuations in rainfall had a stronger impact on plant communities than on microbial communities indicating that the later are likely adapted to the characteristic fluctuation of annual rainfall in areas under Mediterranean climate.

The understanding of such interdependencies can be relevant to understand weed population dynamics in dryland cereal fields and may enhance management strategies for weed control. We used spatial statistical tools derived from point process theory. In particular, we compared the two spatial configurations by assuming two different point patterns. We did so by replacing the random weed fields by a related point pattern and comparing it with the point pattern of harvester ants. Our results suggest that areas with a high density of ant nests are, in this case study, in areas with low weed richness and that large nests have a greater impact than small nests. Considering that only one field was analysed, preserving and enhancing regular ant nest distributions, especially of large nests, might have an impact on depleting weeds and consequently enhancing weed control.","Marta"

The selection of herbicide-resistant B. tectorum populations has further complicated B. tectorum management. A survey of wheat growers was conducted in 2021 and 2022 to understand B. tectorum management practices. The survey included four questions based on the growing seasons from 2017 to 2022 related to crop rotation, tillage versus no-tillage, irrigation versus dryland, and herbicide programs. To determine the extent of herbicide resistance, seeds were collected from 49 B. tectorum populations in wheat fields in northeastern Oregon and tested for resistance. Herbicides tested were clethodim, glyphosate, imazamox, mesosulfuron, metribuzin, propoxycarbazone, pyroxasulfone, pyroxsulam, quizalofop, and sulfosulfuron. Winter wheat-summer fallow rotation was the most predominant cropping system in the region. Most of the fields were in no-tillage systems, and none were irrigated. Pyroxasulfone applied preemergence and acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors applied postemergence were the most often used herbicides for B. tectorum control in winter wheat. Glyphosate was the most frequently used herbicide for B. tectorum control in summer fallow. Resistance screenings confirmed that 46 of the 49 B. tectorum populations were resistant to ALS inhibitors with different cross-resistance patterns. Two populations were resistant to metribuzin and exhibited multiple resistance to ALS inhibitors. All populations were susceptible to clethodim, glyphosate, pyroxasulfone, and quizalofop. The widespread occurrence of ALS inhibitor-resistant B. tectorum populations limits effective postemergence herbicide options in winter wheat.","Marta"
46,NA,"not vetted","Effect of fall-planted cover crops on weed suppression, grain sorghum yield, and profitability in the semiarid Central Great Plains","Integrating cover crops (CCs) in dryland crop rotations could help in controlling herbicide-resistant weeds. Field experiments were conducted at Kansas State University Agricultural Research Center near Hays, KS, from 2020 to 2023 to determine the effect of fall-planted CCs on weed suppression in grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], crop yield, and net returns in no-till dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-grain sorghum-fallow (W-S-F) rotation. The field site had a natural seedbank of glyphosate-resistant (GR) kochia [Bassia scoparia (L.) A. J. Scott] and Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson). A CC mixture [winter triticale (xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus [Secale x Triticum])-winter peas (Pisum sativum L.)-canola (Brassica napus L.)-radish (Raphanus sativus L.)] was planted after wheat harvest and terminated at triticale heading stage before sorghum planting. Treatments included nontreated control, chemical fallow, CC terminated with glyphosate (GLY), and CC terminated with GLY+ acetochlor/atrazine (ACR/ATZ). Across 3 yr, CC terminated with GLY+ACR/ATZ reduced total weed density by 34% to 81% and total weed biomass by 45% to 73% compared with chemical fallow during the sorghum growing season. Average grain sorghum yield was 786 to 1,432 kg ha-1 and did not differ between chemical fallow and CC terminated with GLY+ACR/ATZ. However, net returns were lower with both CC treatments (-US$275 to US$66) in all 3 yr compared with chemical fallow (-US$111 to US$120). These results suggest that fallow replacement with fall-planted CCs in the W-S-F rotation can help suppress GR B. scoparia and A. palmeri in the subsequent grain sorghum. However, the cost of integrating CCs exceeded the benefits of improved weed control, and lower net returns were recorded in all 3 yr compared with chemical fallow.","Marta"

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were measured by static chambers in three growing seasons (2015-18) in the framework of a long-term experiment of different tillage systems established in 2002. Tillage management remained the same throughout the trial, while chemical weed control was carried out in response to the actual weed content. Environmental variables were monitored, including the soil total organic carbon (TOC) content, water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), soil temperature and water content. Total CO2 emission, as mean of the studied seasons, did not significantly differ between NT and RT (2.35 and 2.24 t CO2-C ha(-1) for NT and RT, respectively), although differences were found at the growth cycle scale. Total annual CO2 emission from NT was stable, being the same along the three cycles, while total RT CO2 emission decreased from the first to the third cycle. The TOC content was almost stable, while WEOC showed large variability that could explain the variability of CO2 emissions for RT over short time scales and was probably because of weed control in the middle of the second growing cycle. CO2 emissions were driven by soil water content via the impact on water filled pore space, and soil temperature range, that is daily maximum minus minimum temperature. In conclusion, for this winter wheat NT did not improve the balance of soil CO(2 )emissions with respect to RT.","Marta"

Nine fall- and spring-sown cover crops (CCs) grown during the traditional fallow period were evaluated at sites in the low and intermediate precipitation zones of the region in a 2-year study (2021 and 2022). The fall-sown CCs included winter pea (Pisum sativum L.), winter lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), and fall species mix; and the spring-sown CCs included common vetch, yellow mustard, lacy phacelia, tillage radish (Raphanus sativus L.), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and a spring species mix. CCs were evaluated for biomass production and impacts on soil water and weeds. CC growth was dependent on location, year, planting timing, and CC species. Fall-sown CCs generally produced more biomass than spring-sown CCs across site-years, with winter peas and the fall species mix being most productive. Following a year of greater than average precipitation, no negative effects of CCs on fall soil moisture were observed at the intermediate precipitation site, while fall-sown CCs reduced soil moisture at the low precipitation site. The suppressive effect of CCs on weeds ranged from null to moderate, depending on site, year, and CC seeding time. Fall-sown CCs more consistently suppressed weeds than spring-sown CCs. Additionally, fall-sown CCs were terminated in the spring before weeds set viable seeds, saving a herbicide application and reducing herbicide pressure without exacerbating future weed issues. Overall, select fall-sown CCs showed promise to enhance ecosystem services during the traditional fallow period.","Marta"

Surveys were carried out in Akcahisar, Cakmak, Gelibolu, Comlekci, Akpinar, Golpinar, Akziyaret, Bahceli, Golgen, Kizlar, Kulafli, Sakca, Karatas and Asik villages located about 25 km away from city centre on north-east direction in 2002, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 years. Villages were selected through purposive sampling method. Farmers in such villages were selected randomly. Each farmer was asked a 23- questions. The results revealed that crop rotation of wheat or barley in first year and the lentil in the following year tend to turn to be barley in first year and the lentil in second year. Farmers adopted newly released varieties with high yielding ability rapidly. Sowing time shifted from mid-November to mid-December. There was no constrains for tillage and sowing. Farmers were found to be sufficient for agricultural machinery. Seeding, fertilizer and weed management practices were adopted by farmers with the near ratios of recommended rates. Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis), smut, (Ustilago spp.)powdery mildew (Eryciphe graminis) and bund (Tilletia spp.)diseases were given priority. Rodents and sunn pest (Eurigaster integricieps)were found to be most important pests. Harvest was performed by combine harvester totally. Average barley yield for all survey years (243.7 kg/da) higher than that of wheat was (225.35 kg/da). Average sale price for wheat for all survey years was 111.79 Kr/kg and that of barley was 96.81 Kr/kg. Climatological factors (26, 83%), high fertilizer input prices (21.57%) and low marketing prices (15.16%) were found to be major constrains for cereal cultivation. It was predicted that temperate cereal cultivation for incoming years will seriously be under risk due to huge fluctuations in annual rainfall and barley acreage will increase in future due to early maturing ability and the ability to escape from terminal drought.","Marta"

The statistical significance between treatment means was determined at 5% significance level. Data were recorded on weed density, protein, fat and ash contents of wheat grains. Weed density in shallow tillage was highest (20.67 m(-2)) while it was lowest (14.23 m(-2)) in deep tillage. In weed control factor, weed density was highest in weedy check (33.10 m(-2)), followed by parthenium aqueous extract (21.50 m(-2)), and lowest (6.79 m(-2)) in plots treated with Affinity (isoproturon + carfentrazone). Results showed that the highest crude protein content (10.88%) was recorded in deep tillage, while lowest (10.45%) in shallow tillage, indicating that tillage depths have an impact on wheat grains protein content. For weed control factor, the crude protein content was highest (11.98%) in Affinity treated plots, followed by herbicides, Buctril super (bromoxynil + MCPA) (11.44%) and Puma super (fenoxaprop-p-ethyl) (11.12%). Hence, the control measures also affected crude protein content of wheat grains, which is also obvious from the weedy check where wheat grains crude protein content was lowest (9.73%). The two years combined data analysis also showed the highest crude fat content (1.75%) in deep tillage treatments followed by normal tillage (1.67%) and lowest fat content (1.53%) in shallow tillage. For ash content, the highest content (3.03%) was with Affinity herbicide treatments, followed by Buctril super (2.74%) and Puma super (2.48%) herbicides. In conclusion, both the tillage and herbicides indicated positive effects on the nutritive status of wheat grains.","Marta"

In this study, we examined the effect of pre-emergence microwave (MW) soil treatment for weed management in a no-till wheat production system in Australia. One-time MW soil treatment (2.45 GHz, 600 W, 120 s) was applied to plots that were arranged in a randomized complete block design with five replicates. The MW energy was projected through a horn antenna with aperture dimensions of 5.5 cm x 11 cm into the topsoil (0 to 6 cm) horizon. The applied MW energy density in the treated plots (2.6 m(2)), which was calculated by Simpson's numerical surface integral approximation, was approximately 560 J cm(-2). This achieved an increase in soil temperature of about 75 degrees C to 80 degrees C. This temperature induced a 65% to 80% reduction in weed establishment through thermal devitalization of the weed seedbank, compared to the untreated control plots. In addition, a substantial increase in wheat grain yield of 39.2% was achieved through MW energy application (7.8 t ha(-1)) compared to non-MW conditions (5.6 t ha(-1)). In summary, this non-chemical weed management strategy promises to effectively control herbicide-resistant weeds and sustain dryland wheat yields.","Marta"

The results showed that acetochlor at a dosage of 750 g hm(-2) could effectively control weeds in wheat fields and benefit the growth of wheat in dryland. The plant height, ear length, number of tillers, aboveground and underground dry weight were heavier compared to the control after the application of acetochlor. From the jointing period to the filling period, the residual amount of acetochlor in the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers was gradually reduced in the overall change, and the residual amount of acetochlor in the 0-20 cm soil layer in each growth period was more than the residual that of in the 20-40 cm soil layer. At the time of harvest, the residual amount of acetochlor in wheat grains was lower than the maximum allowable residue limit (MRL) value of acetochlor on wheat recommended by the United States. In addition, the residue of acetochlor in the soil of wheat field was also very small, all of which were lower than 0.02 mg kg(-1). It can be seen that the application of acetochlor is safe for wheat field soil and humans if the wheat is applied once after sowing, at the dosage is 750 g hm(-2).","Marta"

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of cropping system (conventional vs. organic), tillage management (plowed at a depth of 30 cm vs. subsoiled at a depth of 20 cm), and the interaction between cropping system and weather conditions on yield and grain quality of durum wheat. The study was part of a long-term experiment carried out in a rainfed Mediterranean environment of Central Italy where a 3-year crop rotation (durum wheat-tomato-chickpea) was compared in organic and conventional cropping systems. The study period lasted from 2005 to 2011. The combined effect of cropping system and weather conditions determined strong differences in durum grain yield and quality parameters. The durum grain yield was on average 15% lower in organic compared to conventional, although the yield gap between the cropping systems varied from -5 to -32% across the years. The air temperature influenced the grain yield more in organic than in conventional, while high rainfall during the grain filling stage produced a higher grain yield in conventional than organic due to a different weed infestation. A severe water stress period starting from stem elongation determined a poor grain yield and low protein concentration, while high temperatures and water stress throughout the grain filling period resulted in a poor yield, yet high protein content in both cropping systems. Conventional wheat generally showed a higher level of vitreousness and gluten quality, while protein and gluten content were higher in conventional compared to organic when a regular rainfall distribution occurred throughout the wheat reproductive period. These results are probably due to a lower nitrogen supply in organic compared to conventional wheat. Yield and grain quality of durum wheat under different tillage managements such as plowed and subsoiled soil were comparable. Considering subsoiling as an important mode of conservation tillage, the results highlight that it is advisable to use a subsoiler for durum wheat production. Weed control and nitrogen supply appear to be the main factors, which hinder yield production and grain quality especially when an excess of rainfall and low temperatures occur throughout the crop reproductive period in organic durum wheat production.

The aim of the present study was to determine the existence of long-term trends in a weed community and to identify the factors that determine them. A common trend was extracted that captured the main signal of abundance over time, indicating latent influences affecting all species. Canonical correlation analysis showed strong associations between the common trend and specific weed species, suggesting differential responses to this latent factor. Local (temperature and precipitation) and global weather factors (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)) were considered as explanatory variables to explain the common trend. The local weather variables considered did not play a significant role in explaining the commonly observed trend. Conversely, NAO showed a significant relationship with the weed community, indicating its potential role in shaping long-term weed dynamics. DFA was found to be useful for studying the variability in multivariate weed time-series without the need for detailed a priori information on the underlying mechanisms governing weed population dynamics. Overall, this study provided valuable insights into the long-term drivers of weed dynamics and set the stage for future research in this area.","Marta"

This study, conducted from 2011 to 2014 in a Mediterranean environment, evaluated the changes in weed community composition in two cropping systems [conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG)] with different soil tillage [inversion tillage (IT) and non-inversion tillage (NoIT)] in a wheat-tomato-chickpea rotation that began in 2000. The treatments were replicated three times according to a randomised complete block design. The organic system was managed according to EU regulations. Inversion tillage consisted of mouldboard ploughing to a depth of 30cm, while NoIT consisted of subsoiling to a depth of 20cm. Weed control was based on herbicide application in CONV and mechanical weeding in ORG. The organic non-inversion system showed the highest weed biomass (134, 128 and 195gdry matter (DM)m(-2) in wheat, tomato and chickpea, respectively) and weed density (66, 77 and 76plantsm(-2) in wheat, tomato and chickpea, respectively), as well as community richness. However, ORG always increased weed diversity, even if annual dicotyledon species were abundant in ORG-IT and perennial dicotyledon species in ORG-NoIT. The conventional system enhanced the relative frequency of both annual (CONV-IT) and perennial (CONV-NoIT) grasses. There was a negative correlation between density of perennial weeds and crop yield (r(2)=0.24, P<0.001). Therefore, in the Mediterranean environment, combining organic practices with non-inversion tillage could lead to the establishment of perennial weeds that are difficult to control, thus requiring specific weed management practices.","Marta"

The comparative analysis of this effect in relation to alternative systems or practices is essential for a comprehensive appreciation in their merit. This field experiment was comprised of four three-year rotation cycles. Wheat (Triticum turgidum durum) was seeded for two consecutive years after common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), treated in three different ways, and after fallow and compared with three wheat monocultures: the conventional one, the continuous straw incorporation, and the sewage sludge incorporation once every three years. Wheat grain and straw yields and N uptake were compared among treatments. Results showed that rotation systems that included vetch were the most promising for improving sustainability. Maximum N uptake and the greatest yield surpluses were obtained when wheat followed vetch incorporated during flowering. When vetch in the rotation was cut for hay or left to fill grains subsequent wheat showed also enhanced yields. Fallow affected the rotation system's fertility due to the incorporation of volunteer plants into the soil. Sewage sludge sustained production without the need for inorganic fertilization during three years. Straw incorporation always gave the smallest yields and N harvests, presumably due to soil N immobilization.","Marta"

Field experiments were conducted over two winter wheat growing seasons in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 near Adams, OR, to evaluate QP efficacy on feral rye and for crop safety. Downy brome and jointed goatgrass control with QP were assessed in 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, respectively. QP treatments provided effective control of feral rye (>= 95%), downy brome (>= 87%), and jointed goatgrass (99%) regardless of rate, adjuvant, and spray volume tested.

Crop diversification has undisputable environmental benefits and plays a central role in the agroecological transition toward sustainable and resilient farming systems. Among other crop candidates, safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is recently attracting the attention of Mediterranean farmers, due its broad environmental suitability, low input needs, high plant vigor, also in marginal soil conditions, and tolerance to low temperatures. Thus, in the whole Mediterranean basin, safflower could be grown with a winter cycle, differently than sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The availability in the market of high-oleic safflower varieties tremendously enlarges the applications of its oils, easily meeting the needs of the domestic bio-based industry. Aiming at evaluating the feasibility of high-oleic safflower as a winter oilseed crop in the Mediterranean region, a multi-year and multi-location study has been carried out, across multiple growing seasons (2019-2021), at eight locations across Emilia-Romagna (ER) and Tuscany (TU) regions (Italy), traditionally devoted to winter cereal cultivation. In each region, the locations were chosen as representative of optimal, mean, and marginal conditions. The trials were managed as on-farm experiments by local farmers, to define safflower suitability to available equipment and practices. All trials were rainfed and carried out under low input agronomic management and using mechanical weed control. The safflower seed yield was not affected by growing region (grand mean: 1775 kg DM ha-1), while 1000-seed weight and seed oil content were significantly influenced by growing environment. In particular, safflower produced significantly heavier seeds in Emilia Romagna (40.8 vs. 38.2 g, ER vs. TU, respectively, P < 0.05), while seed oil content was higher in Tuscany (TU vs. ER, 40.3 vs. 36.1% DM respectively, P < 0.05). Safflower confirmed its compositional stability with oleic acid representing > 75% of total fatty acids, but, again, some differences were revealed between regions, with ER having significantly higher oleic acid content than TU (78.8 vs. 75.9%, ER vs. TU, respectively). High oleic safflower, grown in winter, confirmed to be an interesting opportunity for Mediterranean farmers who are willing to differentiate their rotations while producing an oilseed crop with several biobased applications and able to increase local production of vegetable oil and protein.","Marta"

IWM practices for controlling L. rigidum are of high importance, mainly due to its widespread resistance that precludes chemical control as a single management method. The objective of this contribution is to simulate different IWM scenarios with special emphasis on the impact of different levels of barley sowing densities on L. rigidum control. To this effect, a weed-crop population model for both L. rigidum and barley life cycles was developed. Our results point out: (i) the necessity of achieving high control efficiencies (>99%), (ii) that the increase of twice the standard sowing density of barley resulted in a reduction of 23.7% of the weed density, (iii) non-herbicide-based individual methods, such as delayed sowing and weed seed removal at harvest, proved to be inefficient for reducing drastically weed population, (iv) the implementation of at least three control tactics (seed removal, delay sowing and herbicides) is required for weed infestation eradication independently of the sowing rate, and (v) the effect of an increase in the sowing density is diluted as a more demanding weed control is reached. Future research should aim to disentangle the effect of different weed resistance levels on L. rigidum population dynamics and the required efficiencies for more sustainable IWM programs.","Marta"

A common feature of permanent cropping with annual crops is the frequent change of crop choice, depending on market opportunities or other motives. However, the precise effect of crop shifts on weeds in tropical areas is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the short-term effect of crop sequences on the diversity of weed communities in smallholder fields of Northern Thailand. Crop choices were upland rice, maize, fallow and young tree plantations with or without intercrop. We counted the number of crop shifts and the number of crops involved during a 3-years period preceding weed sampling. We showed that the number of crop shifts did not affect weed density and biomass. However, herbaceous species number and diversity (measured as Shannon index) increased by 36% and 46% respectively, while herbaceous species dominance decreased by 38%, in fields with yearly crop shifts compared to fields with no shifts in the previous three years. The effect of a particular crop on diversity, or the effect of intercropping with young trees, was weaker. It was likely due to the more variable resources (especially light) in fields with two crop shifts, allowing species with different niches to co-exist. Crop type and frequent crop shifts did not affect shrub and tree species number, diversity or dominance. Some species were strongly associated with fields with no crop shift in the sequence (e.g. the tree Antidesma velutinosum) or to fields with two crop shifts in the sequence (e.g. the herb Centella asiatica, the C-4 grass Digitaria radicosa). Overall, this study showed that in this agronomical system, maintaining yearly crop shifts does not significantly affect weed abundance, but supports in-field plant species diversity, which is likely to impact the services provisioned by tropical mountainous agro-ecosystems.","Marta"

The three tillage treatments were conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT). The climatic conditions influenced wheat yield, yield components, soil water content and weeds. When the autumn-winter rainfall was abundant and constant (69.7% of annual rainfall), wheat grain yield (4465 kg ha(-1)) and yield components (3897kg ha-1 of straw biomass and 584.5 ear m(-2)) were highest. Wheat grain yield was highest with NT: 3549.9 kg ha(-1) (compared to MT: 2955.1 kg ha(-1) and CT: 2950.3 kg ha(-1)) and ear number per m(2) was significantly lower with MT (332 no ear m(-2), compared to 426 and 411.6 ear m(-2) in CT and NT-systems respectively). Soil water content, at earing stage, was the highest in NT (27.36% of soil moisture) while MT showed the lowest content (11.83% of soil moisture). The higher weed measurements (means of 2.557 plants m(-2); 1.443 species m(-2) and 2.536 g m(-2)) was with higher annual rainfall (488mm). Throughout the experiment it was the dominant presence, in MT-wheat plots, of Lolium rigidum Gaudin (with means from 4.87 to 7.71 plants m(-2)), which reduced the ear number per m(2). Our study revealed that in the short term, under semi-arid conditions, only the adoption of NT system (rather than MT) showed economic benefits.","Marta"

The objective was to assess pigweed control with combinations of a winter wheat cover crop (CC), three soybean row widths (76, 38, and 19 cm), row-crop cultivation 2.5 weeks after planting (WAP), and an herbicide program to develop integrated pigweed management recommendations. All combinations of the four components were assessed by 16 treatments. All treatments with the herbicide program resulted in excellent (>97%) pigweed control and were analyzed separately from the other components. Treatments containing row-crop cultivation reduced pigweed density and biomass 3 and 8 WAP in all locations compared with the 76-cm row width plus no CC treatment. CC impacts were mixed. In Riley County, Palmer amaranth density and biomass were reduced; in Reno County, no additional Palmer amaranth control was observed; in Franklin County, the CC had greater waterhemp density and biomass compared with the treatments containing no CC. Narrow row widths achieved the most consistent results of all cultural components when data were pooled across locations: Decreasing row widths from 76 to 38 cm resulted in a 23% reduction in pigweed biomass 8 WAP and decreasing row width from 38 to 19 cm achieved a 15% reduction. Row-crop cultivation should be incorporated where possible as a mechanical option to manage pigweed, and narrow row widths should be used to suppress late-season pigweed growth when feasible. Inconsistent pigweed control from CC was achieved and should be given special consideration before implementation. The integral use of these components with an herbicide program as a system should be recommended to achieve the best pigweed control and reduce the risk of developing herbicide resistance.","Marta"

Leaves extracts of Moringa oleifera, Parthenium hystorophorus and Cannabis sativa alone and in different combinations along with a control (distilled water) were sprayed to explore the allelopathic potential for weed management in wheat-maize cropping system. Foliar application of moringa + parthenium + cannabis leaves extract was the best treatment to reduce the number of leaves, leaf length and shoot length of all tested weed species. Leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of weed plants was significantly reduced under exogenously application of leaf extracts. Various phenolic compounds were also detected in parthenium, cannabis and moringa leaf extracts. Maximum phenolic compounds were found in parthenium followed by cannabis and moringa leaf extracts. The combination of leaf extracts of Moringa oleifera (MLE) with Parthenium hysterophorus (PLE) and Cannabis sativa (CLE) (water extract at 3%) was significantly impactful to suppress weeds in wheat and achieve higher wheat growth.","Marta"

A 3-year field experiment was conducted near the town of Northam in the wheat-belt of Western Australia to test the hypothesis that inclusion of summer cover crops would increase ground cover, water storage and grain yield in subsequent wheat crops. White French millet (Panicum miliaceum) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cover crops and a weedy fallow were compared to a typical chemical fallow over the summer period. Autumn groundcover was 10-30% higher when summer weeds were left uncontrolled compared to the chemical fallow treatment. Dry-sown and late established (February) millet failed to increase groundcover, whereas cowpea demonstrated a small increase (similar to 9-10%) in one season, when cowpea biomass approached 1 t ha(-1). Cover crops and weeds growing over summer had no significant effect on total plant available water (0-50 cm depth) prior to sowing wheat in any season. However, there was less readily available soil N in the cover crop (less 10-30 kg N ha(-1)) and weedy fallow (less 50 kg N ha(-1)) treatments prior to the second wheat crop. Despite some significant effects of weedy fallow and cowpeas on Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici (take-all) and Didymella pinodes (causing black pea spot), disease levels were low and thought to pose little risk to following winter crops. Wheat grain yields were not significantly different between treatments, other than a low yield after cowpeas in 2015 due to a low wheat emergence count. Grain protein and screenings were not generally affected by summer fallow treatment in any year, except for higher screenings after the weedy fallow in one year. Given the limited impacts of cover crops and weeds on soil water and disease, it is possible that summer cover crops may be able to be integrated with cereal winter rotations in Western Australia without yield reductions in wheat crops. In light of current chemical usage, issues around herbicide residues in soil and herbicide-resistant weeds, it would be worthwhile revisiting the need for chemical fallow, particularly in the higher rainfall areas.","Marta"
66,NA,"not vetted","Minimum tillage and no-tillage winter wheat-summer fallow for low precipitation regions","Dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the principal crop grown on 3.35 million ha (8.28 million ac) of the semiarid Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States. In areas with less than 300 mm (12 in) of annual precipitation, challenges for wheat production are similar to those found in the Mediterranean region and Australia. Successful crop production depends on adequate precipitation capture and storage and weed control, which prove problematic under no-tillage (NT), the most effective soil conservation practice. Sweep-tillage (ST) is proposed as an equally effective conservation system, with local conventional wisdom saying that it produces higher yields than NT systems. A study established in 2006 and concluded in 2018 evaluated the performance of NT and ST winter wheat-summer fallow production systems. The null hypothesis for this research assumed no statistically significant differences in any of the soil and plant characteristics measured between NT and ST treatments. Sixteen 0.04 ha (0.10 ac) plots were established in a randomized complete block design, with two rotation entry points for a total of four treatment plots per year replicated in four blocks. Data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. The NT system produced significantly higher crop yields and higher precipitation use efficiencies than the ST system (NT 3.38 +/- 0.33, ST 2.66 +/- 0.27 Mg ha(-1) [NT 50 +/- 5, ST 40 +/- 4 bu ac(-1)]). Infiltration rates were higher and soil temperatures were lower in the NT system. The higher yields and lower soil temperatures in the NT system were unexpected and contrary to previous research conducted in this region.YY","Marta"

This is particularly true in low-input rice-based cropping systems in the Malagasy highlands, where weed management is mainly done by manual removal. Crop rotation is often promoted as an efficient way to control weed infestations, while the role of fertilization is more controversial. In this study, we compared rice monoculture to three rainfed rice-based two-year rotations: rice followed by groundnut, rice followed by sorghum-cowpea mixture, and rice followed by a velvet-bean crotalaria mixture. Each rotation was tested with two levels of fertilization (5 t DM ha(-1) organic manure, sole or in combination with mineral fertilizer - 400 kg ha(-1) NPK + 200 kg ha(-1) urea). We assessed the effect of rotation and fertilization on weed composition, diversity, biomass and rice yield. Additionally, the farmers' perception of weed harmfulness and the relation between their assessment of weed harmfulness and rice production was tested. Our results showed that weed biomass significantly decreased rice yield but only under the low fertilization level. The rotation of rice with the velvet beancrotalaria mixture was efficient in reducing weed biomass, modified weed community composition and allowed to achieve the highest rice yield. A significant negative relationship was found between weed community harmfulness index and weed species richness. Yet, the lowest rice yield was observed under rice monoculture despite a higher species richness over years and under high fertilization level. The lack of significant correlation between the harmfulness index and the actual rice yield is probably because our index is partly based on farmer's perception, and only on major weeds. More studies on tropical weed harmfulness are needed to support the design of ecologically intensified cropping systems.","Marta"
68,NA,"not vetted","Intensifying rotations increases soil carbon, fungi, and aggregation in semi-arid agroecosystems","Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) is a critical but daunting challenge in semi-arid agroecosystems. For dry land farmers, low levels of SOC and aggregation exacerbate the risks of farming in a water-limited environment risks that will compound with climate change. Many dryland farmers in semi-arid climates use year long periods called summer fallow, where no crops are grown and weeds are controlled, to store rainwater and increase the yield of the following crop. In semi-arid climates around the world, dryland farmers are increasingly replacing summer fallow with a crop, a form of cropping system intensification. Cropping system intensification has the potential to increase SOC, but the drivers of this effect are unclear, and may change based on environmental conditions and management strategy. We quantified SOC, water-stable aggregates, and fungal and microbial biomass on 96 dryland, no-till fields in the semi-arid Great Plains, USA, representing three levels of cropping system intensity from wheat-fallow to continuous (no summer fallow) rotations along a potential evapotranspiration gradient. Cropping system intensity was positively associated with SOC, aggregation, and fungal biomass, and these effects were robust amidst variability in environmental and management factors. Continuous rotations averaged 1.28% SOC at 0-10 cm and had 17% and 12% higher SOC concentrations than wheat-fallow in 0-10 cm and 0-20 cm depths, respectively. Aggregate stability in continuous rotations was about twice that in wheat-fallow rotations. Fungal biomass was three times greater in continuous rotations than wheat fallow, but was not significantly different from mid-intensity rotations. Using structural equation modeling, we observed that continuous cropping, potential evapotranspiration, % clay content, and fungal biomass together explained 50% of the variability in SOC, and that SOC appears to enhance aggregation directly and as mediated through increases in fungal biomass. Overall, the model suggests that cropping system intensity increases SOC both directly, through greater C inputs to soil, and indirectly, by increasing fungal biomass and aggregation. Our findings suggest that continuous cropping has the potential to provide gains in SOC and soil structure that will help offset C emissions and enhance the resilience of dryland agroecosystems.","Marta"

Populations at the Landscape Scale","The repeated application of herbicides has led to the development of herbicide resistance. Models are useful for identifying key processes and understanding the evolution of resistance. This study developed a spatially explicit model at a landscape scale to examine the dynamics of Lolium rigidum populations in dryland cereal crops and the evolution of herbicide resistance under various management strategies. Resistance evolved rapidly under repeated herbicide use, driven by weed fecundity and herbicide efficacy. Although fitness costs associated with resistant plants reduced the resistance evolution, they did not affect the speed of its spread. The most effective strategies for slow resistance involved diversifying cropping sequences and herbicide applications. Pollen flow was the main dispersal vector, with seed dispersal also making a significant contribution. Strategies limiting seed dispersal effectively decreased resistance spread. However, the use of a seed-catching device at harvest could unintentionally enrich resistance in the area. It would be beneficial to optimize the movement of harvesters between fields. The model presented here is a useful tool that could assist in the exploration of novel management strategies within the context of site-specific weed management at landscape scale as well as in the advancement of our understanding of resistance dynamics.","Marta"

The adoption of Conservation Agriculture, based on minimum tillage, permanent soil cover, and crop rotations, has improved soil quality, enhanced crop productivity, and help mitigate financial risk. However, emerging issues that threaten sustainability, such as herbicide resistance, inputs costs rising disproportionately to product prices, and increasing climate variability and unpredictability, drive the need for innovation in small-grain Mediterranean-based CA systems. The aim of the review was to evaluate a set of agroecological practices which constitute a Regenerative Agriculture (RA) concept, for their potential to address these challenges from a soil quality, crop productivity and whole-farm economics perspective. Organic soil amendments derived from agro-wastes, offer promising perspectives for supplying appropriate quantities of nutrients to reduce or replace mineral fertilisers and offset their economic and agroecological costs. Although the viability of microbial bioeffectors in small-grain agroecosystems was largely under question, non-microbial bioeffectors and certain combination options represent more efficient and cost-effective uses of this technology. Their widely reported abiotic stress priming functions and crop productivity enhancement under poor growing conditions may improve yield stability and financial resilience in small-grain Mediterranean CA systems. Finally, multi-species cover crops subjected to adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing as a phase within the crop rotation may reduce weed pressure, enhance soil multi-functionality, and resilience against environmental stresses. To validate the potential of these technologies in Mediterranean small-grain systems, more long-term and context-specific research is called for.","Marta"

In this region, the use of cover crops represents a promising approach to increase biodiversity and reduce external inputs; however little information exists about how cover crop mixture composition, predicted climate and management systems could impact the performance of cover crops and weed communities. In the 4th cycle of a cover crop-wheat rotation, we experimentally increased temperature and reduced moisture as expected to occur with climate change, and assessed impacts on the presence and composition of cover crop mixtures and termination methods on weed communities. Under ambient climate conditions, mean total cover crop biomass was 43%-53% greater in a five species early-season cover crop mixture compared with a seven species mid-season mixture, and differences were less pronounced in warmer and drier conditions (19%-24%). We observed a total of 18 weed species; 13 occurring in the early-season mixture, 13 in the mid-season mixtures and 14 in the fallow treatments. Weed species richness and diversity was lower in warmer and drier treatments, and we observed a shift in weed communities due to the presence and composition of cover crop mixtures as well as climate manipulations. Overall, results suggest that adoption of cover crop mixtures in semiarid agroecosystems requires jointly addressing weed management and soil moisture retention goals, a challenge further complicated by predicted climate conditions.","Marta"

However, few studies exist on the efficacy of this technology in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). This research compared the herbicide efficacy (reduction in weed density and cover) of WEED-IT and WeedSeeker spot spraying systems to uniform spraying in fallow and postharvest in 2019 and 2020. Weed community types included naturally occurring weeds, natural + Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.), or natural + kochia (Bassia scoparia (L.) A. J. Scott). Herbicides included glyphosate or the pre-mix bromoxynil + pyrasulfotole. Additionally, herbicide efficacy was studied with short stubble (~10 cm), tall stubble (~25 cm), and normal stubble (~20 cm) with chaff and straw removed. In fallow, herbicide efficacy was 1.5 times higher for uniform applications than for WEED-IT or WeedSeeker in 2019 and 2020. Herbicide efficacy was also 1.9 times higher for uniform applications in postharvest in 2019 but no differences were found in 2020. The weed community impacted herbicide efficacy but herbicide efficacy did not differ between residue management treatments. Finally, WEED-IT and WeedSeeker used 53% less herbicide volume in comparison to uniform applications. This research demonstrated that spot spraying technology can be efficacious and economical for growers in the PNW.","Marta"

The three treatments were based on increasing levels of diversity in the rotation, from 'monoculture wheat', 'cereal rotation' and 'diverse rotation'. These treatments, except monoculture wheat, were based on three phase (year) rotations with every phase presented every year. Any winter/spring cereal may be grown in the 'cereal rotation' treatment, while the diverse rotation was based on a wheat-legume-brassica sequence. For the period 2007-2010, residue was spread across the plot behind the harvester. The plots were split after 2010 with residue spread on half of each plot, and the other half having the residue windrowed and burnt prior to seeding, which reduced residue levels by 40-66%. This reduction in residue level had a positive effect on wheat yield in years with high levels of cereal residue and had negative, or no effect, when residue levels were relatively low (< similar to 3000 kg ha(-1)). By contrast, the effect of windrow burning of canola residue on following wheat yield was negligible, even at high residue levels. Therefore the effect of crop residue on wheat yield depended on the type and amount of material.Monoculture wheat and cereal rotation had the highest cumulative 9-year average gross margins, despite the diverse rotation showing higher grain protein concentration in most years and improved wheat yield over time. Lower gross margins in the diverse rotation were associated with poor legume performance in many years and low canola yields in dry seasons. Improving the reliability of these break crops in this growing environment is the key to increasing their uptake by farmers. Cover crops in the rotation negatively impacted gross margins, without any observed yield benefits in the following years, therefore should not be recommended to replace the one cash crop per year in this low rainfall Mediterranean-type environment.","Marta"

The development of a biocontrol technique may be an optional approach to weed control. Bipolaris panici-miliacei strain SX5-2 was isolated from diseased Microstegium vimineum plants. Pathogenicity, host range test, culture and mass production, crop sensitivity, formulation development and field trials were conducted to evaluate the potential of this strain for a bioherbicide. Pathogenicity tests showed percent incidence was up to 90% at a conidial suspension concentration of 10(5) conidia/mL on M. vimineum under greenhouse conditions and more than 80% in the field. Host range tests on 57 species in 17 families determined that B. panici-miliacei strain SX5-2 was safe for rice, wheat, sorghum, soybean, cotton, vegetables, Zoysia japonica turf and most dicotyledonous plants. Only maize and sugar cane were severely infected. Pathogenicity bioassays showed that the strain could control those seven tested gramineous weeds Digitaria sanguinalis, Panicum virgatum, Echinochloa crus-galli, Microstegium japonicum, Microstegium nodosum, Sorghum sudanense and Leptochloa chinensis in the main dryland and paddy fields. Culture and mass-production studies revealed that combined submerged and solid fermentation with bran and sawdust was feasible for mass production of conidia. Therefore, based on virulent pathogenicity and feasible mass production, B. panici-miliacei may have a promising potential to be developed into a bioherbicide for biocontrol of grass weeds in most crops but not in susceptible maize or sugarcane.","Marta"

Key findings were that weed density within crops was low, with 72% of cropping paddocks containing fewer than 10 grass weeds/m(2) at anthesis. Weed density and herbicide resistance were not correlated, despite the most abundant grass weed species (annual ryegrass, Lolium rigidum Gaudin) testing positive for resistance to at least one herbicide chemistry in 92% of monitored paddocks. A wide range of herbicides were used (369 unique combinations) suggesting that the diversity of herbicide modes of action may be beneficial for reducing further development of herbicide resistance. However, there was a heavy reliance on glyphosate, the most commonly applied active ingredient. Of concern, in respect to the evolution of glyphosate resistant weeds, was that 45% of glyphosate applications to canola were applied as a single active ingredient and area sown to canola in Western Australia expanded from 0.4 to 1.4 million hectares from 2005 to 2015. In order to minimise the weed seed bank within crops, pastures were used infrequently in some regions and in 50% of cases pastures were actively managed to reduce weed seed set, by applying a non-selective herbicide in spring. The use of non-selective herbicides in this manner also kills pasture plants, consequently self-regenerating pastures were sparse and contained few legumes where cropping intensity was high. Overall, the study indicated that land use selection and utilisation of associated weed management actions were being used successfully to control weeds within the survey area. However, to successfully manage herbicide resistant weeds land use has become less diverse, with pastures utilised less and crops with efficacious weed control options utilised more. Further consideration needs to be given to the impacts of these changes in land use on other production factors, such as soil nutrient status and plant pathogens to assess sustainability of these weed management practices in a wider context.","Marta"

Four cropping systems: sole maize (Zea mays), maize + runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) (2:2), maize + cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) (2:2) and maize + bitter gourd (Momordica charantia Mizo.) (2:1) were applied in the main-plots and three organic nutrient management regimes: FYM at 10 t ha-1 (N1), FYM at 10 t ha-1 + vermicompost at 2 t ha-1 (N2) and FYM at 10 t ha-1 + vermicompost at 2 t ha-1 + pot manure (N3) were applied in the sub-plots. The study revealed that maize + cowpea and maize + runner bean were the best performing cropping systems, resulting in higher weed smothering efficiency (WSE), B:C ratio, rainwater use efficiency (RWUE) and improved soil quality. Similarly, N3 was the best organic nutrient management regime with higher growth and yield parameters, net return, RWUE, energy use efficiency, positive nutrient balance, enhanced productivity and sustainability of the system, and with additional pest control efficacy. Hence, the cultivation of maize + cowpea and maize + runner bean with FYM at 10 t ha-1 + vermicompost at t ha-1 + pot manure was recommended for small and marginal farmers during the rainy season in rainfed conditions.","Marta"

However, summer fallow is costly since weeds must be controlled and crops are not grown. Replacing summer fallow with grain crops can generate low economic returns. Previous research indicated that annual cool-season forages can be substituted for summer fallow in dryland cropping systems. Our objective was to determine if annual warm-season species were suited for forage production in monocultures and polycultures in the U.S. northern Great Plains. Dry matter (DM) production by 20 warm- and cool-season crop monocultures and 4 polycultures was determined across six environments during 2016, and by 25 warm- and cool-season crop monocultures and polycultures across four environments from 2016 through 2018. Maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture produced forage DM in amounts equal to, or greater than, those produced by other warm- and cool-season crop treatments (P < 0.05). Maize DM production averaged 2.5 to 5.7 Mg ha(-1), depending on the study and environment. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.] and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) also produced relatively large amounts of forage DM. Polycultures failed to produce more DM than monocultures consistently (P > 0.40). These results indicate that maize and other warm-season crops are adapted for dryland forage production in cool regions at upper latitudes. Additional research is needed to determine the impacts of annual warm-season forages on grain yield in a forage-wheat crop sequence.","Marta"

Those weeds produce most of their seeds post-harvest. The objectives of this study were to determine the ability of an optical sensor, installed for on-the-go measurement of grain protein concentration, to detect the presence of green plant matter in flowing grain and assess the potential usefulness of this information for mapping weeds at harvest. Spectra of the grain stream were recorded continuously at a rate of 0.33 Hz during harvest of two spring wheat fields of 1.9 and 5.4 ha. All readings were georeferenced using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with 1 m positional accuracy. Chlorophyll of green plant matter was detectable in the red (638-710 nm) waveband. Maps of the chlorophyll signal from both fields showed an overall agreement of 78.1% with reference maps, one constructed prior to harvest and the other at harvest time, both based on visual evaluations of the three green weed species conducted by experts. Information on weed distributions at harvest may be useful for controlling post-harvest using variable rate technology for herbicide applications.","Marta"

Considering that crop nutrient management is going through a continuous revisitation process to improve nutrient use efficiency and energy savings, we addressed the consequences of different nutritional levels (low, optimal, and surplus) on weed community composition and wheat growth, yield, and kernel quality. Weed density and biomass were evaluated on sampling areas at the heading stage, and the data obtained were subjected to a cluster analysis for the identification of different weed communities throughout the experimental plots. At harvest, plant growth, yield and quality traits of wheat and wheat kernels were evaluated and correlated with the presence of different weed communities. Out of the four weed communities identified under optimal and low nutrition, two communities did not significantly reduce wheat yield. Under surplus nutrition only one weed community was identified, which resulted to be detrimental for wheat production in terms of yield quantity and quality. The non-detrimental communities were characterized by a high presence of corn chamomile (Anthemis arvensis L.), birdeye speedwell (Veronica persica Poir.), and common chickweed (Stellaria media (L.) Vill). On the contrary, the detrimental communities, were characterized by a high density and aboveground biomass of burr medic (Medicago polymorpha L.). Finally, under surplus nutrition, species richness declined, and the density and aboveground biomass of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.) increased compared to optimal and low nutri-tion. Our results showed that soil fertilization plays a crucial role in differentiating detrimental vs. non-detrimental weed communities, with excess fertilization reducing species richness and selecting for competi-tive and specialized weed species. Overall, an efficient management of soil nutrients may promote non-detrimental weed communities while reducing weed management intensity and thereby improving biodiver-sity and sustainability. Assessing the efficiency of soil fertilization management and understanding how different fertilization rates and forms may affect weed communities is crucial to advancing sustainable weed management.","Marta"
80,NA,"not vetted","Applying more nitrogen is not always sufficient to address dryland wheat yield gaps in Australia","Yield gaps, which reflect the difference between the yield a grower achieves in a field, and the water-limited yield potential of that field, have been extensively discussed in the last decade. To date, most analyses have occurred at regional levels, and derived insight through surveys, remote sensing, or small scale targeted case studies. Here, we provide an analysis based on a survey of 250 fields from 2015 to 2018 inclusive. Biotic factors, nutrients and crop yields are all monitored. Crop models were calibrated locally at each site. Regression and Classification Trees (RCART) were used to determine the key drivers of the yield gap in wheat, and again used to identify attributes contributing to a yield gap for a field regardless of crop type. The mean yield gap from 697 wheat crops, collected over 4 years, was 1.03 t/ha (MSE = 2.23 t/ha). This equated to a mean wheat yield gap of 20.3 % +/- S.D 36.2 %. 18 % of fields had repeated yield gaps of 20 % or more, irrespective of crop type. The RCART analysis demonstrated that for wheat, the yield potential of the crop was the most important predictor, where fields with high yield potentials were most likely to have a higher yield gap. Nitrogen was the second most important predictor. Yield gaps of wheat crops grown in high yielding regions were also related to crop rotation, leaf diseases and weed populations. In low rainfall zones, wheat yield gaps were related to the presence of soil pathogens including Pratylenchus sp., Pythium sp. and Fusarium sp. In conclusion, yield potential and nitrogen are important predictors of the yield gap. Increasing nitrogen inputs would address the yield gap in 25 % of wheat crops. In 22 % of wheat crops, increasing nitrogen inputs will not correct the gap, as other biotic stresses are often present, that require sophisticated agronomic intervention. In the remaining 53 % of wheat fields yield gaps were less than 0.37 t/ha.","Marta"

Mediterranean regions are characterized by low soil fertility and stressful conditions that limit the effect of technological improvements on increasing yield gains, while worsening the negative CC impacts. Additionally, organic farming (OF) lacks specifically adapted genetic material. Accordingly, there is a need to search for varieties adapted to these conditions and whose cultivation may help semi-arid agroecosystems sustainability, focusing on specific agronomic and functional traits. To this purpose, wheat landraces and modern wheat varieties were evaluated under Mediterranean rainfed conditions during three growing seasons under contrasting situations: A conventional farm and an organic farm. Results regarding straw production, weed biomass and biodiversity, and grain N concentration suggest that the cultivation of landraces under Mediterranean rainfed conditions can enhance agroecosystem sustainability through positive effects on ecosystem services such as soil quality, functional biodiversity, or grain protein content, without significant reductions in grain yield. Results highlight the relevant role of wheat landraces as genetic resources for the development of cultivars adapted to Mediterranean agroecosystems conditions, especially for organic farming, but also for conventional agriculture.","Marta"

An occasional tillage is proposed to alleviate these, but only limited information is available on the effect of a single or occasional tillage on crop yield in a no-till wheat grain-sorghum-fallow (WSF) rotation. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of a single tillage to a 10-cm depth of a long-term (>6 yr) continuous no-till WSF system on grain yield, soil water, and water use of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for up to 3 yr after the single tillage operation. This research was conducted at Garden City and Tribune, KS. The three tillage treatments were a single tillage in May or June during fallow (June tillage), a single tillage after wheat harvest (July tillage), and a complete NT system. Grain yield of sorghum varied from average of 3.40 Mg ha(-1) at Garden City in 2014 to 8.04 Mg ha(-1) at Tribune in 2016. Grain yield of winter wheat varied from average of 0.47 Mg ha(-1) at Garden City in 2014 to 5.21 Mg ha(-1) at Tribune in 2016. There was no significant effect from a single tillage (June tillage or July tillage) on crop yield, yield components, biomass, available soil water (ASW), and water use compared with continuous no-till. Therefore, we have concluded that a single tillage of a long-term no-till dryland WSF system can be done without affecting crop performance.","Marta"

Herbicides such as metribuzin are commonly used to control weeds. However, wheat has a narrow safety margin against metribuzin. Standing crops such as wheat with weeds in the same field can also be killed by the same dose of metribuzin. Therefore, it is important to identify metribuzin resistance genes and understand the resistance mechanism in wheat for sustainable crop production. A previous study identified a significant metribuzin resistance wheat QTL, Qsns.uwa.4 A.2, explaining 69% of the phenotypic variance for metribuzin resistance.ResultsTwo NIL pairs with the most contrasting performance in the metribuzin treatment and different in genetic backgrounds were compared using RNA sequence analysis, identifying nine candidate genes underlying Qsns.uwa.4 A.2 responsible for metribuzin resistance. Quantitative RT-qPCR further validated the candidate genes, with TraesCS4A03G1099000 (nitrate excretion transporter), TraesCS4A03G1181300 (aspartyl protease), and TraesCS4A03G0741300 (glycine-rich proteins) identified as key factors for metribuzin resistance.ConclusionIdentified markers and key candidate genes can be used for selecting metribuzin resistance in wheat.","Marta"

A 4-year rotational experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-canola (Brassica napus L.)-grain legumes-wheat in sequence was established at Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia, in a semiarid Mediterranean-type environment where long-term average annual rainfall is 541 mm and the incidence of summer rainfall is episodic and unreliable. The objectives of the experiment were to investigate whether (i) tillage increases N2O emissions and (ii) nitrogen (N) application can improve productivity without increasing N2O emissions. The base experimental design for each crop phase was a split-plot design with tillage treatment (tilled versus no-till) as the whole plot, and N fertiliser rate (0, 25, 50 and 100 kg N/ha) as the subplot, replicated three times. This paper reports high resolution N2O emission data under a canola crop. The daily N2O emission rate averaged 0.55 g N2O-N/ha. day, ranging between -0.81 and 6.71 g N2O-N/ha. day. The annual cumulative N2O-N emitted was 175.6 and 224.3 g N2O-N/ha under 0 and 100 kg N/ha treatments respectively. There was no evidence to support the first hypothesis that tillage increases N2O emissions, a result which may give farmers more confidence to use tillage strategically to manage weeds and diseases where necessary. However, increasing N fertiliser rate tended to increase N2O emissions, but did not increase crop production at this site.","Marta"
85,NA,"not vetted","Does increased cropping intensity translate into better soil health in dryland wheat systems?","Despite reliable grain yields, the 13-month fallow period in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - fallow systems (WF) in low precipitation zones (<350 mm annually) poses several challenges including soil erosion, soil organic matter (SOM) decline, weed management, and overall soil health degradation. Therefore, considerable research efforts are focused on reducing the frequency of fallow and reducing or eliminating tillage. We compared the widely practiced 2-year WF rotation to two 3-year crop rotations with only one year of fallow and continuous annual spring cropping. These systems have been evaluated over the past 10-plus years using undercutter conservation-till and no-till practices in a large-scale and long-term cropping systems experiment near Ritzville, WA USA. To date there is limited research-based information about the influence of these intensified crop rotations using conservation- and no-till compared to traditional conservation-till WF on soil health indicators, particularly microbial activity, and microbial community dynamics in the dryland region of inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW). This study was conducted as a part of Soil Health Institute's North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements (NAPESHM). We leveraged the aforementioned ongoing long-term (25-year-old) experiment to obtain these data. Soil samples were collected at 0-15 cm depth from different crop rotation treatments that included, 1. winter triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack)-spring wheat-no till fallow (WT-SW-NTF); 2. continuous annual no-till spring wheat (CSW-NT); 3. winter wheat-undercutter conservation-till fallow (WW-TF); and 4. winter wheat-spring wheat-undercutter conservation-till fallow (WW-SW-TF). Soil samples were analyzed for an array of soil health indicators. Out of the 21 tested soil health indicators, eleven indicators were significantly influenced by crop rotations. These were SOM, carbon mineralization potential (24-h respiration), water extractable carbon (WEC), active C, potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN), water extractable nitrogen (WEN), soil pH, NO3-N and NH4-N, phosphatase enzyme activity, and wet aggregate stability (WAS). Within responsive indicators, all C-related biological indicators (SOM, WEC, active C, and 24-h respiration) were highest under WW-SW-TF rotation while N-related indicators (WEN, PMN, and inorganic N) were highest under CSW-NT rotation. The improvements in aforementioned soil properties in the 3-year winter wheat-spring wheat-undercutter conservation-till fallow rotation was likely because of the higher crop biomass production in this rotation as compared to the other tested rotations.","Marta"
86,NA,"not vetted","Seven rainfed wheat rotation systems in a drought-prone Mediterranean climate","Increasing cropping intensity and use of no-till fallow (NTF) has been successful in many rainfed Mediterranean agricultural regions around the world, including of the Inland US Pacific Northwest (PNW) where annual precipitation exceeds 290 mm. However, in the low-precipitation (<290 mm annual) region east central Washington and north-central Oregon, these practices have not been widely adopted and a 2-year winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-tilled summer fallow rotation is practiced by the vast majority of farmers. The objective here was to evaluate the productivity of seven wheat rotation systems that reduce or eliminate tillage and increase cropping intensity in a 6-year study at Lind, WA. The study included: (i) soft white, hard red, and hard white market classes of wheat; (ii) both NTF and undercutter conservation tillage summer fallow (UTF), and; (iii) continuous annual no-till cropping of wheat. Crop-year (September 1-August 31) precipitation over the six years averaged just 217 mm. Across years, market class, and rotation system, spring wheat (SW) grain yield was only 33% of winter wheat (WW) after UTF. Thus, although only one crop was produced every other year with WW-UTF, this system had water use efficiency (WUE) of 5.5 grain/mm precipitation versus as low as 3.0 kg grain/mm precipitation for SW with no preceding fallow year. Possible mechanisms for differences in grain yield and WUE among rotations were: (i) Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.) weed infestation was at least eleven times greater in the various SW systems and much greater still with WW after SW with no fallow year compared to in WW after NTF and UTF, and; (ii) precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) in the 180 cm soil profile during fallow for NTF-WW-SW was only 30% compared to 39 and 42% for the UTF-WW-SW and UTF-WW treatments, respectively. Critically, the seed zone of NTF was too dry for early planting of WW in most years whereas adequate seed-zone water was present every year in the UTF systems. Primarily due to late planting necessitated from lack of seed-zone water, grain yield of WW after NTF was reduced 35% compared to WW after UTF. Optimum grain yields and soil conservation are both required for sustainable agriculture, and WW with the UTF method was the clear winner of systems evaluated in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Fourteen treatments were carried out that from 1 to 9 included trifluralin. Treatments 1, 2, and 3 were with increasing doses of trifluralin (480, 720, and 960 g ai ha-1) applied 30 d before planting. Treatments 4, 5, and 6 included increasing doses of trifluralin (480, 720, and 960 g ai ha-1) applied 15 d before planting. Treatments 7, 8 and 9 consisted of increasing doses of trifluralin (480, 720, and 960 g ai ha-1) applied at the time of planting. Treatments 10, 11, and 12 included pyroxasulfone (85 g ai ha-1), flumioxazin (51 g ai ha-1) and imazethapyr (100 g ai ha-1), respectively. These last three treatments were carried out at the time of planting; treatments 13 and 14 were: weed-infested (without weed control) and weed-free (manual weeding during the entire season). Flumioxazin 66% and pyroxasulfone 57% (mean of two samples) reduced weed dry weight compared to uncontrolled treatment. The results showed that the treatments were significantly different for 100-seed weight, biological yield, and seed yield of chickpea. Weed-infested and weed-free plants had the lowest and highest grain yield, respectively. Herbicide treatments of flumioxazin, trifluralin 960 g ai ha-1, and pyroxasulfone at planting produced 55%, 44%, and 40% higher grain yield, respectively, than the weed-infested plots. Also, none of the herbicide treatments reduced chickpea yield and biomass. The herbicide residues had no adverse effect on wheat growth in the next crop season.","Marta"

Allelopathy is one of the possible reasons resulting in crop yield reduction. In this study, we analyzed the allelopathic effect of velvetleaf volatile oil components on germination and seedling growth of three dryland crops, wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), and soybean (Glycine max). A total of 26 compounds in velvetleaf volatile oil were identified by GC-MS, accounting for 98.1% of the total chromatographic peak areas. The terpenes with lower molecular weight in the volatile oil were alpha-pinene, eucalyptol, alpha-terpinolene, beta-terpinene, trans-alpha-ionone, and trans-beta-ionone. The saturated aqueous solution of velvetleaf volatile oil could inhibit seed germination of three crops by filter paper and soil. Velvetleaf volatile oil could inhibit the seedling growth of three crops through air, filter paper, and soil. Wheat was the most susceptible to volatile oil, followed by maize and soybean. The inhibitory effect of volatile oil on the growth of wheat was the strongest in air medium, followed by filter paper and soil medium. The lower molecular weight of terpene components from volatile oil might be the important allelochemicals.苘麻是旱田常见杂草,可造成作物减产,化感作用是造成减产的可能原因之一。本研究分析了苘麻挥发油成分对3种旱田作物小麦、玉米和大豆种子萌发和幼苗生长的化感作用。结果表明: 应用气相色谱-质谱(GC-MS),从苘麻挥发油中鉴定出26种化学成分,占总峰面积的98.1%,其中,低分子量萜类成分有alpha-蒎烯、桉树醇、alpha-松油烯、beta-松油烯、反式alpha-紫罗兰酮、反式beta-紫罗兰酮。苘麻挥发油饱和水溶液能通过滤纸和土壤2种基质抑制3种作物种子萌发。苘麻挥发油能通过空气、滤纸和土壤3 种基质抑制3种作物幼苗生长,对小麦的抑制作用最强,玉米和大豆次之。苘麻挥发油对小麦生长的抑制作用以空气载体最强,滤纸和土壤载体次之。挥发油中低分子量的萜类成分可能是重要的化感成分。.","Marta"

In semiarid cropping systems of the Northern Great Plains, there is a lack of knowledge to how ground beetles are affected by diversified cover crop rotations. In a 2-yr study (2018 and 2019), our experiment was a restricted-randomization strip-plot design, comprising summer fallow, an early-season cover crop mixture (five species), and a mid-season cover crop mixture (seven species), with three cover crop termination methods (i.e., herbicide, grazing, and haying). Using pitfall traps, we sampled ground beetles in five 48-h intervals throughout the growing season (n = 135 per year) using growing degree day (GDD) accumulations to better understand changes to ground beetle communities. Data analysis included the use of linear mixed-effects models, perMANOVA, and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations. We did not observe differences among cover crop termination methods; however, activity density in the early-season cover crop mixture decreased and in summer fallow increased throughout the growing season, whereas the mid-season cover crop mixture peaked in the middle of the summer. Ground beetle richness and evenness showed a nonlinear tendency, peaking in the middle of the growing season, with marginal differences between cover crops or fallow after the termination events. Also, differences in ground beetle composition were greatest in the early- and mid-season cover crop mixtures earlier in the growing season. Our study supports the use of cover crop mixtures to enhance ground beetle communities, with potential implications for pest management in dryland cropping systems.","Marta"

In the French Mediterranean area, green manures can generally be implemented during summer, after spring crops or short cash crops like melon, zucchini or cucumber, but the species choice must be adapted to the high temperature conditions and short available periods under greenhouse in summer. Several trials have been conducted during summers in 2001 to 2002 and 2013 to 2015 under greenhouses. During the first period, we have screened a large panel of families and species to evaluate their performances in terms of biomass production, weed competition and sensitivity to pests and diseases. The second period was dedicated to legume green manures to enhance nitrogen availability for the crops. Performances of legumes were assessed and their effect on the subsequent crop of lettuce was measured. Our results showed that plants from the Poacea family, like sorghum-sudan grass species and pearl millet are usually the most efficient to reduce weeds and to produce a high biomass (8-12 t DM ha(-1)) in less than 2 months. Brassicacea species, like mustards or fodder radish also produce high biomass but are the most sensitive to pests and diseases. Buckwheat is a very good green manure for short periods with a cycle of 30 to 40 days. Most of the species from the Fabaceae family are usually not adapted to hot temperatures under greenhouse. Tropical species of Vigna sinensis and Dolichos lablab gave the best results, and field pea was the only temperate specie to resist particular conditions of greenhouses in summer. However, higher biomass production and weed competition were obtained in mixtures of legumes and graminaceous species. First results on lettuce as the subsequent crops did not always show better results after green manuring of legumes, but more trials are needed to validate the interest for legumes in organic greenhouses during summer.","Marta"
91,NA,"not vetted","Camelina: Long-term cropping systems research in a dry Mediterranean climate","Camelina [Camelina saliva (L.) Crantz] is a short-season annual oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family. Interest in camelina has increased substantially during the past 15 years because the oil is an excellent feedstock for producing low-carbon-emission biofuel and has a unique fatty acid profile as a potential edible oil. Camelina has been promoted as an alternative crop in low-precipitation dryland regions because of its low fertilizer requirement and drought tolerance. An 8-yr field experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2017 at the WSU Dryland Research Station near Lind, WA to compare a 3-yr winter wheat (WW)-spring camelina-summer fallow (SF) rotation with the traditional 2-yr WW-SF rotation. Annual crop-year (Sept. 1-Aug. 31) precipitation ranged from 193 to 375 mm and averaged 281 mm. Camelina seed yield ranged from 339 to 1175 kg/ha and averaged 643 kg/ha. Mean WW yield of 2692 kg/ha in the 3-yr rotation was significantly lower (p = 0.046) compared to 2862 kg/ha in the 2-yr rotation. Soil profile water was significantly lower (p < 0.001) after harvest of camelina compared to after WW harvest in the 2-yr rotation. This soil water reduction was consistently measured throughout the ensuing 13-month fallow cycle. There are no labeled in-crop broadleaf weed herbicides for camelina and populations of Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.) and tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum L) were higher in camelina than in WW. This was likely a factor in the deep extraction of soil water in the camelina plots to a depth of 180 cm. Data from this study suggest that, with current cultivars and management practices, camelina is not yet agronomically or economically stable or viable in a 3-yr WW-camelina-SF rotation in the low-precipitation (< 300 mm annual) rainfed cropping region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (PNW).","Marta"
92,NA,"not vetted","Socio-economic impacts of zero and reduced tillage in wheat fields of the Moroccan drylands","Zero tillage (ZT) is recommended for dryland farming because it enhances retention of residual soil moisture. However, it is not always clear whether this translates to an economic advantage over conventional tillage, which helps in controlling weeds. Using a nationally representative sample of 1901 wheat fields in Morocco as a case study, we provide comparative analysis on different tillage intensities. Results from an endogenous switching regression model showed that fields that were not tilled gave 298.6 kg/ha (23%) higher yields, US$89/ha (27%) more income and more stable yields than those tilled once or more. Fields that were not tilled also had 87% lower yield variance with 100% and 65.6% less risk of giving yield levels below 500 and 1000 kg/ha, respectively. The highest yield losses occurred during the first and third tillage passes, but the second had negligible effect. Labor saving from avoiding tillage under ZT was undermined by higher labor needed for weeding. Along with biophysical benefits documented elsewhere, our results show that, if constraints for its wider diffusion are removed, zero or reduced tillage has the potential to sustainably improve the economic and biophysical viability of dryland agriculture in Morocco and other similar countries in North Africa and West Asia.","Marta"

In both models, climatic and soil characteristics were defined as independent variables and presence absence of the dominant weeds as the dependent variable. The geographical coordinates of each field was overlaid on georeferenced map of the province for producing the distribution of weed species maps in ArcGIS. Also, the zonation maps developed by using GIS based on LR models. Demographic indices of weed species were calculated, and the dominant weeds were determined. In the area under study, 61 and 74 weed species were identified on chickpea and winter wheat fields, respectively. The results indicated that Galium aparine L, Convolvulus arvensis L., Scandix pectin-veneris L and Tragopogon graminifolius DC. at three-leaf stage (99, 81, 71 and 70, respectively), Convolvulus arvensis and Tragopogon graminifolius at podding stage of chickpea (96 and 77, respectively); and Convolvulus arvensis, Tragopogon graminifolius, Turgenia latifolia (L.) Hoffm. and Carthamus oxyacantha M. B. at heading stage of winter wheat (95, 80, 78 and 72, respectively) were the dominant weeds with the highest abundance indices. The logit models did not show good fitness and could not fit any models for Galium aparine at three leaf stage and dominant weeds at podding stage of chickpea. However, ANN could develop the best suited models for prediction all dominant weeds with high MSE values. Sensitivity analysis on the optimal networks revealed that altitude and rainfall were the most significant parameters.

94,NA,"not vetted","Invasive Cereal Aphids of North America: Ecology and Pest Management","Aphid invasions of North American cereal crops generally have started with colonization of a new region or crop, followed by range expansion and outbreaks that vary in frequency and scale owing to geographically variable influences. To improve understanding of this process and management, we compare the invasion ecology of and management response to three cereal aphids: sugarcane aphid, Russian wheat aphid, and greenbug. The region exploited is determined primarily by climate and host plant availability. Once an area is permanently or annually colonized, outbreak intensity is also affected by natural enemies and managed inputs, such as aphid-resistant cultivars and insecticides. Over time, increases in natural enemy abundance and diversity, improved compatibility among management tactics, and limited threshold-based insecticide use have likely increased resilience of aphid regulation. Application of pest management foundational practices followed by a focus on compatible strategies are relevant worldwide. Area-wide pest management is most appropriate to large-scale cereal production systems, as exemplified in the Great Plains of North America.","Marta"

However, achieving these services in dryland cropping systems can be highly challenging, and cover crops may carry a greater risk of causing ecosystem disservices. Assessment of the balance of ecosystem services vs disservices is critical for understanding the potential role of cover crops within dryland cropping systems. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects of cover cropping in drylands on soil water and soil mineral nitrogen content at sowing of subsequent cash crops and their yields compared to control fallows. A total of 38 articles were examined, for a total of 1006 cash crop yield, 539 soil water, and 516 soil mineral nitrogen independent studies, spanning the period 1994-2021. On average, cover cropping reduced cash crop yield by 7%, soil water content by 18%, and soil mineral nitrogen by 25%, with significant variation across climates, soil types, and crop management conditions. Subsequent cash crop yields changed by +15, +4, -12, and -11% following cover crops in tropical, continental, dry, and temperate dryland climates, respectively. The most significant yield benefits were proportionate to soil water content and soil mineral nitrogen at the time of cash crop sowing. This is the first meta-analysis to demonstrate that minimum annual precipitation of similar to 700 mm represents a break-even point to realize significant cash crop yield benefits of cover cropping compared to control fallows in dryland environments. The successful incorporation of cover crops into dryland cropping systems requires careful planning based on context-specific biophysical conditions to minimize trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices.","Marta"

However, such benefits are usually not uniform across a spatially variable environment. It is important to identify where long fallow would have a role in increasing crop yield and economic return. OBJECTIVE: To examine the spatial pattern of yield and economic performance of integrating long fallow into a wheat cropping system in dryland Mediterranean environments of Western Australia. METHODS: The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) driven by 0.05 degrees gridded climate over the dry period of 1990-2020 was used to simulate five rotations (fallow followed by one, two, three or four wheat crops, respectively) and continuous wheat. With offset simulations, simulated wheat yields, plant available water at sowing after a wheat crop or long fallow and N fertilizer requirement were compared and analysed for fallow -wheat and wheat-wheat. Wheat yields and economic returns were also calculated for each rotation and compared with continuous wheat.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Wheat yield and economic responses to long fallow showed clear geographic patterns that increased from the south-west to north-east across the wheatbelt, which could be explained by climate and soil conditions. Yield increase from fallow could be >6%, equivalent to 13% of economic increase, in the areas where growing season rainfall was <230 mm and the difference in plant available soil water at sowing between fallowed and continuously cropped soil was >30 mm. Although fallow resulted in overall reduction in crop production, integrating one fallow into a continuous wheat sequence every three or more years might achieve similar profit to continuous wheat for fields with weeds and diseases challenges in the north-eastern wheatbelt.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of yield and economic performance after fallow in the context of space and crop sequence provide a systematic analysis to map where and how fallow could be adopted into cropping systems.","Marta"

Bioenergy feedstocks derived from Brassica oilseed crops have been considered for production of hydrotreated renewable jet fuel, but crop growth and yields in the northwestern region are limited by a lack of plant available water. Based on a review of the scientific literature, several areas were identified where research could be directed to provide improvements. The current agronomic limitations for oilseed production are mainly due to seedling establishment under extreme heat, dry seedbeds at optimum planting times, survival under extreme cold, and interspecific competition with weeds. To improve emergence and stand establishment, future work should focus on developing soil management and seeding techniques that optimize plant available water, reduce heat stress, and provide a competitive advantage against weeds that are customized for specific crops, soil types, and soil and environmental conditions. Spring and winter cultivars are needed that offer increased seedling vigor, drought resistance, and cold tolerance.","Marta"

Weed infestation by annual species is a serious issue in such a system. Stylosanthes guianensis, a legume cover crop, can be grown with rice as a living mulch but its effect on the weed community and rice yield was not yet well studied. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted in Mid-West Madagascar from 2016 to 2018. A no-till system with stylosanthes (NT) managed as a living mulch was compared to the conventional tilled (CT) system. Two fertilisation regimes were included: organic manure (F1) and organic manure combined with mineral fertiliser (F2). Weed floristic surveys were performed, and weed harmfulness evaluated by comparing weedy and weed-free plots. The living mulch harmfulness was evaluated using weed-stylosanthes-free plots. Results showed that NT suppressed dominant grass weeds Digitaria spp. and Eleusine indica leading to a decrease in total weed biomass. Rice yield was significantly higher in NT than in CT; in weed-free condition, it was 2.4 versus 2 t ha(-1) in NT and CT, respectively, and 1.5 versus 0.6 t ha(-1) in NT and CT, respectively, in weedy condition. The living mulch reduced rice yield by 14% but it remained significantly higher in NT than in CT. The addition of mineral fertiliser to the organic manure had a positive effect on rice yield but only in weed-free conditions. This study showed that a no-till system with a living mulch can help to control the most competitive weeds without undermining rice production.","Marta"

These challenges include ensuring cropping system resilience and productivity under changing water and temperature regimes while reversing soil degradation, reducing crop susceptibility to pests, pathogens and weed competition, and exploiting genetic resources to develop cultivars with resilience to climate stresses and improved compatibility with cropping system innovations. Meeting these interdependent challenges requires transdisciplinary efforts that integrate knowledge across many scientific domains. The USDA-NIFA-funded coordinated agricultural project, Regional Approaches to Climate Change for Pacific Northwest Agriculture (REACCH), employed this transdisciplinary approach to address climate change and sustainability challenges for rain-fed cereal-based systems in the semi-arid intermountain Pacific Northwest. To engage with and contribute to similar efforts globally, REACCH sponsored a workshop Transitioning Cereal Systems to Adapt to Climate Change (TCSACC) in November 2015. Participants from 17 countries and five continents with expertise in agronomy, crop physiology, crop modeling, crop protection, breeding and genetics, sociology and economics shared their perspectives, successes, and challenges to achieving transdisciplinary research integration for semi-arid cereal systems under changing climates. Conference goals were to: (1) strengthen the global network of researchers addressing climate change effects on semi-arid cereal-based systems, (2) share the approaches to achieving transdisciplinary collaboration to advance climate change resilience in cereal systems, and (3) identify the elements of a collaborative research agenda that are needed to advance global food security in the twenty-first century. This paper distills the conference themes and summarizes the calls to action that were discussed: Establish coordinated, large scale, transdisciplinary efforts; Consider Genetic x Environment x Management x Social system (G x E x M x S) interactions; Integrate social, economic, and biophysical science, and engineering; Improve integration among knowledge communities; Consider global context of production systems; Develop more inclusive cropping system models; Enable comprehensive data management and data sharing; Include landscape and ecosystem services perspectives; Establish and support existing global collaboration networks.","Marta"

We assessed the impact of soil moisture, soil tempera ture, weed communities, and disease status on soil bacterial communities in three cropping systems: (i) conventional no-till (CNT) systems utilizing synthetic pesticides and herbicides, (ii) USDA-certified tilled organic (OT) systems, and (iii) USDA-certified organic systems with sheep grazing (OG). Sampling date within the growing season and associated soil temperature and moisture exerted the greatest effect on bacterial communities, followed by cropping system, Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) infection status, and weed community. Soil temperature was negatively correlated with bacterial richness and evenness, while soil moisture was positively correlated with bacterial richness and evenness. Soil temperature and soil moisture independently altered soil bacterial community similarity between treatments. Inoculation of wheat with WSMV altered the associated soil bacteria, and there were interactions between disease status and cropping system, sampling date, and climate conditions, indicating the effect of multiple stressors on bacterial communities in soil. In May and July, cropping system altered the effect of climate change on the bacterial community composition in hotter conditions and in hotter and drier conditions compared to ambient conditions, in samples not treated with WSMV. Overall, this study indicates that predicted climate modifications as well as biological stressors play a fundamental role in the impact of cropping systems on soil bacterial communities.IMPORTANCE Climate change is affecting global moisture and temperature patterns, and its impacts are predicted to worsen over time, posing progressively larger threats to food production. In the Northern Great Plains of the United States, climate change is forecast to increase temperature and decrease precipitation during the summer, and it is expected to negatively affect cereal crop production and pest management. In this study, temperature, soil moisture, weed communities, and disease status had interactive effects with cropping system on bacterial communities. As local climates continue to shift, the dynamics of aboveand belowground associated biodiversity will also shift, which will impact food production and increase the need for more sustainable practices.","Marta"

From 2007-2019, a 12-yr in-situ experiment consisting of three cropping systems (winter wheat continuous cropping, WW; winter wheat-spring maize rotation, WM; spring maize continuous cropping, MM) and two tillage methods (conservation tillage, subsoiling, ST; conventional tillage, plowing, CT) were conducted in a semi-arid region, and grain yield, economic profit, water use, precipitation storage and loss, soil water balance were analyzed to explore the mechanism and potential of crop rotation and conservation tillage regulating soil water balance and increasing farmland productivity. Our results show that compared to WW, WM and MM significantly enhanced grain yield by 4358 and 8791 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle, respectively. And ST increased grain yield after 3 cycles with 979 kg ha-1. WM and MM with ST significantly reduced precipitation loss (78 and 135 mm) during the fallow period, and increased WUE (6.5 and 10.8 kg ha-1 mm-1), compared to WW-CT. With the passage of time, soil water storage of WW and MM showed a decreasing trend in 100-200 and 0-100 cm layers compared to pre-experiment, with the rate of 18.1 and 13.6 mm per cycle. And ST could ease the downward trend, relative to CT. However, the WM-ST maintained soil water balance by regulating water use and precipitation storage, compared to the two continuous cropping systems. Additionally, correlation analysis showed that evapotranspiration was positive to soil water balance and we should consider crop water use when designing cropping system to prevent soil water deficit. Overall, the WM-ST achieved better soil water sustainability, on the basis of sacrificing grain yield partly (4646 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle) compared to MM-ST, which perhaps more eco-friendly and sustainable agricultural technique to replace WW-CT in the Loess Plateau of China.","Marta"

Predicting S. tragus emergence timing plays a critical role in scheduling weed management measures. The objective of this research was to develop and validate a predictive model of the seedling emergence pattern of S. tragus under field conditions in the PNW to increase the efficacy of control measures targeting this species. The relationship between cumulative seedling emergence and cumulative hydrothermal time under field conditions was modeled using the Weibull function. This model is the first to use hydrothermal time units (HTT) to predict S. tragus emergence and showed a very good fit to the experimental data. According to this model, seedling emergence starts at 5 HTT, and 50% and 90% emergence is completed at 56 HTT and 177 HTT, respectively. For model validation, independent field experiments were carried out. Cumulative seedling emergence was accurately predicted by the model, supporting the idea that this model is robust enough to be used as a predictive tool for S. tragus seedling emergence. Our model can serve as the basis for the development of decision support systems, helping farmers make the best decisions to control S. tragus populations in no-till fallow and spring wheat systems.","Marta"

Twenty-four weed species distributed in the main extensive crops (soybean, maize, wheat, barley, oilseed rape, sunflower, chickpea and peanut) have evolved herbicide resistance. Of the total, 54% are grasses, 88% are annual species and 63% are cross-pollinated species. The most representative families were Poaceae with 54% resistant species, followed by Brassicaceae with 17%, and Asteraceae with 13%. Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Cordoba were the provinces with the most documented cases of resistance (35%, 33% and 30%, respectively). The proportion of cases resistant to pre-emergence herbicides was 10%, whereas the proportion of cases resistant to post-emergence herbicides was 90%. Glyphosate was the herbicide with the highest incidence (92%) of resistance among weed species, followed by 29% of species that evolved resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Whereas resistance to auxin-like herbicides comprised 17% of the weed species, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (8%) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (4%) inhibiting herbicides showed the least incidence of resistance evolution among weeds. The highest number of resistant species was identified in soybean (19), followed by maize (13), wheat/barley (10) and fallow (9). Weed species with a higher number of resistant populations to a higher number of herbicide mode of action were Amaranthus hybridus, A. palmeri, Lolium multiflorum and Raphanus sativus. The change in the production system since the mid-1990s, based on the use of herbicides (glyphosate mainly) to control weeds, is likely to account for the notorious increase in the average rate of evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds in Argentina.","Marta"

Here, we outline a framework for identifying such applications and apply this framework to field trials involving the crop establishment phase of Australian dryland cropping systems. Several chemicals, which are not presently available to farmers in Australia, were identified as providing moderate levels of pest control and seedling protection, with the potential to be less harmful to beneficial groups including predatory mites, predatory beetles and ants. This framework highlights the challenges involved in chemically controlling pests while maintaining non-target populations when pest species are present at damaging levels.","Marta"

Mechanised sowing and weeding were based on using a combined donkey-drawn planter/weeder and a motorised planter/weeder. The research methods included studies of seed delivery in manual and mechanised sowing, field experiments on different levels of mechanization/intensification, labour studies on mechanisation and an economic assessment of the different levels of intensification. The average sorghum grain yield across three years increased by 352 kg ha(-1) (43.7% increase) by combining mechanisation with seed priming and microdosing of 0.2 g NPK 15-15-15 fertiliser per pocket compared to a control with manual sowing but without seed priming and microdosing. The labour demand (sowing and weeding) for manual, donkey-drawn and motorised operations was 184, 67 and 47 hours ha(-1), respectively. An economic analysis showed that the donkey-drawn planter/weeder is the appropriate mechanisation below six ha while above this land size it becomes increasingly interesting for the farmers to invest in a motorised planter. The use of mechanisation will result in earlier and uniform crop establishment, facilitate microdosing application, timelier weeding, higher yields, better economic return and reduced labour demand.","Marta"

However due to climatic inconsistencies and changing farming practices, this is not always the case, and residues can inhibit formation of legume/rhizobia symbioses. Objective or research question: The objectives were to determine whether: i) exposure to triasulfuron, even at extremely low levels, reduces shoot and root growth and nodulation of five diverse and widely sown legume pasture cultivars in Australian farming systems; and ii) sowing legumes prior to recommended plant-back criteria being met for chlorsulfuron, triasulfuron herbicide, clopyralid, and pyroxasulfone herbicides results in unacceptable damage to subsequently sown pasture and crop legumes, causing reduced root and shoot growth, nodulation and N fixation. Methods: A series of glasshouse and field experiments explored herbicide residue impact on commonly used legumes in dryland farming systems. Results: A glasshouse study determined triasulfuron at concentration 0.000225 g a.i/ha, a (1/100,000) dilution of the label rate caused significant (p < 0.001) decrease in nodule count, root length, root, shoot weight for Trifolium spumosum cv. Bartolo and T. subterraneum cv. Dalkeith, and at 0.225 g a.i/ha and 2.25 g a.i/ha for all five cultivars tested. A bioassay assessed T. subterraneum cv. Dalkeith health when grown in field soil-cores taken 4, 7 and 10 months after herbicide application (chlorsulfuron, triasulfuron, clopyralid and pyroxasulfone) to a wheat crop. For all three, herbicide residues significantly decreased (p < 0.001) nodule number, shoot weight, root length and whole plant weight of T. subterraneum cv. Dalkeith compared to control. A field experiment assessed nodulation of five pasture and two crop legumes sown dry (dormant summer sowing), or following rainfall 10.5 months after initial herbicide application. Nodulation of all legume cultivars decreased in plots treated with clopyralid. Chlorsulfuron decreased nodulation for all cultivars except T. glanduliferum and T. subterraneum. Triasulfuron reduced nodulation for all cultivars except Ornithopus sativus and T. spumosum. Pyroxasulfone decreased nodulation of Biserrula pelecinus cv. Casbah and Lupinus angustifolius cv. Mandalup. Conclusions: Herbicide residues from preceding cereal crops reduced fitness and symbiotically fixed N in subsequently sown pasture or crop legumes. Implications or significance: Our study highlighted label plant-back recommendations should be strictly adhered to, despite conflict with modern farming approaches of dry or early sowing) to combat climate change. This outcome may consequently lower profitability and increase the carbon footprint of farming systems.","Marta"

The lack of empirical data for wheat under nonlimiting conditions in this region, however, suggests that maximum reported grain yields for the region might not represent maximum attainable yields. Our objective was to perform the agronomic characterization of wheat grown under nonlimiting conditions across the southern Great Plains. Four dryland and two irrigated fields were sown to 'Iba' winter wheat in the 2012-2013 growing season and repeated during 2013-2014 in central Oklahoma. Fields were intensively managed for fertility for maximum yield and freedom from weeds, insects, and disease. Aboveground dry matter at maturity ranged from 9.95 to 20.5 Mg ha(-1), but harvest index (HI) did not surpass 0.41 and grain yields ranged from 3.06 to 7.68 Mg ha(-1). The highest yield was achieved under irrigated conditions in 2013-2014, but one dryland site produced 7.11 Mg ha-1 grain in 2012-2013. Maximum radiation-use efficiency (RUE) ranged from 0.8 to 1.9 g MJ(-1) and water-use efficiency (WUE) from 7.8 to 12.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). The wheat characteristics measured in this study were near or above maximum values reported in the literature for the region, and our data provide empirical evidence to support maximum attainable wheat yields of 7.68 Mg ha-1 when wheat is grown under nonlimiting conditions in the southern Great Plains.","Marta"

It consumes soil water after wheat harvest, compromising the yield of the following crop. The objectives of this work were to determine the impact of post-wheat harvest herbicide application timing on Russian thistle control and of stubble height on Russian thistle postharvest control and plant dispersal. For the first objective, experiments were conducted at the Columbia Basin Agricultural Research Center, Adams, OR (CBARC), and the Lind Dryland Research Station, Lind, WA (LDRS), in 2020 and 2021. Herbicides evaluated included paraquat, glyphosate, and either bromoxynil + pyrasulfotole (CBARC) or bromoxynil + metribuzin (LDRS). The different post-wheat harvest application timings were 24 h and 1, 2, and 3 wk after harvest. For the second objective, two stubble heights (short and tall) were compared for their impact on control at CBARC and in a production field near Ione, OR. Paraquat provided the greatest control in all scenarios, with no differences in application timings or stubble height. Impacts of application timings were not clear for glyphosate or bromoxynil mixtures. For glyphosate treatments, control in short stubble was 11% greater than in tall stubble in both years. Control was also greater in short stubble for the bromoxynil + pyrasulfotole application in 2020. However, Russian thistle plant dispersal was greater in short stubble at both locations. At CBARC, plant dispersal in short stubble was 58%, compared to 18% in tall stubble. Near Ione, plant dispersal in flattened stubble was 88%, compared to 43% in nonflattened short stubble. Leaving tall stubble at harvest should be considered to reduce Russian thistle plant dispersal if the infestation is going to be left untreated after harvest; otherwise, short stubble might result in better Russian thistle control when using systemic herbicides, such as glyphosate.","Marta"

Weeds are the major constraints for adoption of CA in rainfed regions. A seven years study was done at ICAR- Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad, India, to study the effects of different tillage practices and residue levels on weed shift, diversity and crop yields. It was observed that annual weed species were dominant in conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT), whereas a shift towards perennials was observed in zero tillage (ZT). The CT recorded significantly lower weed density and weed biomass (12.89 m- 2 and 35.60 g m-2) over RT (17.33 m- 2 and 38.37 g m-2) and ZT (36.67 m- 2 and 69.58 g m-2) after seven years, respectively. A shift in weed species, higher weed density and weed biomass in dicots (Tridax procumbens L and Euphorbia hirta L. and a marginal decrease in monocots (Bulbostylis barbata, Digitaria sanguinalis L) was observed in ZT. The marginal decrease in monocots was due to higher precipitation immediately after herbicide application which reduced the control of weeds due to leaching. The anchored residues 10 and 30 cm recorded lower monocots and total weed count over No residue. The study suggests that integrated weed management (combination of herbicide and removal of chance weeds) and in RT are efficient strategies to minimise the weed infestation in CA and these methods not only reduce the over reliance on herbicides but also improve the productivity of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.), castor (Ricinus communis) and the environmental performance of CA. ZT and RT recorded the highest Shannon index, Pielous evenness index and species richness over CT which indicates a higher weed species diversity in ZT as compared to CT. This study helps to improve the understanding of crop-weed communities and in the development of cost effective environmentally sound weed management strategies.","Marta"
110,NA,"not vetted","Effect of summer fallow management on crop yield: Field experiment and simulation analysis","Potential yield of a crop is limited by the factor which most restricts its productivity. In dryland cropping systems this factor is often the available soil water. Nitrogen fertiliser is also a high cost input in crop production systems. Conservation of these resources is essential to increase agricultural productivity and profitability. A field experiment and computer simulation modelling were conducted for the dryland farming system of south eastern Australia to investigate the effect of summer fallow management on growth and yield of canola (Brassica napes L.). A factorial experiment with two residual nitrogen levels and three residual soil water conditions was conducted. Soil water content and crop growth were monitored. At harvest, canola grain yield and above-ground biomass were measured. The biophysical model APSIM was used to analyse the effect of seasonal variation on crop yield by simulating canola grain yield at different residual water and nitrogen levels. The field experiment and simulation modelling indicated that in seasons with high in-crop rainfall, high residual soil water does not increase crop yield. However, residual nitrogen increases crop yield if in-crop rainfall is high. Irrespective of the in-crop rainfall, controlling summer weeds increases crop yield due to residual mineral N and/or residual soil water.","Marta"
111,NA,"not vetted","Supporting Beneficial Insects for Agricultural Sustainability: The Role of Livestock-Integrated Organic and Cover Cropping to Enhance Ground Beetle (Carabidae) Communities","Ground beetles (Carabidae) are beneficial insects providing ecosystem services by regulating insect pests and weed seeds. Despite several studies conducted on ground beetles worldwide, there is a lack of knowledge on how these insects are affected by differently managed organic systems (e.g., tillage-based versus grazed-based) compared to that of chemical-based no-tillage conventional cropping systems. In a 5-year (2013-2017) study, we assessed the ground beetle communities in cover crops and winter wheat (Triticum aestiviumL.) in Montana, USA, with three contrasting cropping systems: a chemically managed no-tillage, a tillage-based organic, and a livestock-integrated organic with reduced tillage. The first three years (i.e., 2013-2015) corresponded to the transition to organic period, while the last two (i.e., 2016-2017) were conducted in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic-certified tillage-based and livestock-integrated organic systems. The experiment was designed with three management systems across three blocks as the whole plot variable and 5-year rotation of crop phases as the subplot variable. Using pitfall traps, we sampled ground beetles across all cover crop and winter wheat subplots for five years (n= 450). The data were analyzed using mixed effects models and PERMANOVA and visualized with non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination. Our study indicated that organically managed farms, whether tilled or grazed, enhance activity density, species richness, diversity, and evenness of ground beetles in the dryland row crop productions. Also, irrespective of farming system, cover crops supported higher species richness, diversity, and evenness of ground beetles than winter wheat. The ground beetle communities were mostly similar during the transition to organic period. However, during the established organic phase, cropping systems acted as contrasting ecological filters and beetle communities became dissimilar. Cover cropping affected ground beetle communities positively not only in organically managed systems but also in chemical-based conventional systems. Our study provides evidence supporting the adoption of ecologically-based cropping systems such as crop-livestock integration, organic farming, and cover cropping to enhance beneficial insects and their pest-regulation services.","Marta"

However, concerns have been raised regarding the long-term effects of glyphosate on soil microbial communities. We examined the impact of repeated glyphosate application on bulk and rhizosphere soil fungal communities of wheat grown in four soils representative of the dryland wheat production region of Eastern Washington, USA. Further, using soils from paired fields, we contrasted the response of fungal communities that had a long history of glyphosate exposure and those that had no known exposure. Soil fungal communities were characterized after three cycles of wheat growth in the greenhouse followed by termination with glyphosate or manual clipping of plants. We found that cropping system, location, year, and root proximity were the primary drivers of fungal community compositions, and that glyphosate had only small impacts on fungal community composition or diversity. However, the taxa that responded to glyphosate applications differed between rhizosphere and bulk soil and between cropping systems. Further, a greater number of fungal OTUs responded to glyphosate in soils with a long history of glyphosate use. Finally, fungal co-occurrence patterns, but not co-occurrence network characteristics, differed substantially between glyphosate-treated and non-treated communities. Results suggest that most fungi influenced by glyphosate are saprophytes that likely feed on dying roots.","Marta"

Proso millet has multiple benefits when consumed as human food. Proso millet is rich in minerals, dietary fiber, polyphenols, vitamins and proteins. It is gluten-free and therefore, ideal for the gluten intolerant people. Proso millet contains high lecithin which supports the neural health system. It is rich in vitamins (niacin, B-complex vitamins, folic acid), minerals (P, Ca, Zn, Fe) and essential amino acids (methionine and cysteine). It has a low glycemic index and reduces the risk of type-2 diabetes. Unfortunately, in the USA, it is mostly considered as bird feed, whereas it is mainly used as human food in many other countries. Besides human health benefits, proso millet has an impeccable environmental benefit. Proso millet possesses many unique characteristics (e.g., drought tolerance, short-growing season) which makes it a promising rotational crop for winter wheat-based dryland farming systems. Proso millet provides the most economical production system when used in a two years wheat/summer fallow cropping system in semiarid High Plains of the USA. It helps in controlling winter annual grass weeds, managing disease and insect pressure and preserving deep soil moisture for wheat. Proso millet can also be used as a rotational crop with corn or sorghum owing to its tolerance for atrazine, the primary herbicide used in corn and sorghum production systems. Proso millet certainly is a climate-smart, gluten-free, ancient, and small grain cereal, which is healthy to humans and the environment. The main challenge is to expand the proso millet market beyond bird feed into the human food industry. To overcome the challenge, unique proso millet varieties for human food and ready-to-use multiple food products must be developed. This requires successful collaboration among experts from diverse disciplines such as breeders, geneticists, food chemists and food industry partners.","Marta"

We assessed the bacterial diversity in soil around wheat roots through the spring and summer of 2016 in winter wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) in Montana, USA, from three contrasting farming systems: a chemically-managed no-tillage system, and two USDA-certified organic systems in their fourth year, one including tillage and one where sheep grazing partially offsets tillage frequency. Bacterial richness (range 605-1174 OTUs) and evenness (range 0.80-0.92) peaked in early June and dropped by late July (range 92-1190, 0.62-0.92, respectively), but was not different by farming systems. Organic tilled plots contained more putative nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera than the other two systems. Bacterial community similarities were significantly altered by sampling date, minimum and maximum temperature at sampling, bacterial abundance at date of sampling, total weed richness, and coverage of Taraxacum officinale, Lamium ampleuxicaule, and Thlaspi arvense. This study highlights that weed diversity, season, and farming management system all influence soil microbial communities. Local environmental conditions will strongly condition any practical applications aimed at improving soil diversity, especially in semiarid regions where abiotic stress and seasonal variability in temperature and water availability drive primary production. Thus, it is critical to incorporate or address seasonality in soil sampling for microbial diversity.","Marta"
115,NA,"not vetted","Landscape-scale cropping changes in the High Plains: economic and environmental implications","A global transformation in semi-arid cropping systems is occurring as dryland (non-irrigated) farmers in semi-arid regions shift from crop rotations reliant on year-long bare fallows, called summer fallow, to more intensively cropped systems. Understanding the rate of cropping system intensification at the landscape scale is critical to estimating the economic and environmental implications of this movement. Here, we use high-resolution satellite data to quantify dryland cropping patterns from 2008 to 2016 in the US High Plains. We use these estimates to scale up our previous field-level research in this region on soil carbon, herbicide use, yields, and profitability. Over the nine year study period, the High Plains witnessed a profound shift in cropping systems, as the historically dominant wheat-fallow system was replaced by more intensified rotations as the dominant systems by land area. Out of the 4 million hectares of non-irrigated cropland in the study area, this shift coincided with a 0.5 million-hectare decline in summer fallow and a concurrent increase in alternative (non-wheat) crops. We estimate that, from 2008 to 2016, these patterns resulted in a 0.53 Tg (9%) increase in annual grain production, 80 million USD (10%) increase in annual net farm operating income, substantial reductions in herbicide use, and an increase in C sequestration that corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 0.32 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year (MMTCO(2)e yr(-1)). We project each of these implications to a scenario of potential maximum 100% intensification and estimate that, relative to 2016 levels, herbicide use would be reduced by more than half, grain production would increase by 25%, net operating income would increase by 223 million USD (26%), and greenhouse gases would be reduced by an additional 0.8MMTCO(2)e yr(-1). The scale of cropping intensification in the High Plains and its environmental and economic impacts has important implications for other regions undergoing similar transformations, and for policy that can either support or hinder these shifts toward more sustainable cropping systems.","Marta"

This weed has excellent growing and surviving characteristics even under extreme stress conditions that may be due to its higher level of phenolic compounds. Similarly, utilization of nanotechnology is a novel and innovative field. Drought is threatening the productivity of wheat worldwide as a main environmental stress, especially in countries like Pakistan, where about 25% of cultivated area is rainfed. The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy spectrum of Carthamus oxyacantha nano-biomass showed the presence of seven functional groups (alcohols, phenols, alkanes, 1-amines, aromatics, aromatic amines and alkyl halides). Plant phenolic compounds can act as antioxidants, structural polymers (lignin), attractants (flavonoids and carotenoids), UV screens (flavonoids), signal compounds (salicylic acid and flavonoids) and defense response chemicals (tannins and phytoalexins). They also play a crucial role in the tolerance mechanisms against a wide range of stresses. So, it was hypothesized that the exogenous application of nano-biomass of aforesaid weed as catalytic agent may improve the drought tolerance of wheat and this technology will be proved as an environment friendly solution for drought prone areas. The nano biomass of the subject weed was prepared through top-down approach and was applied exogenously through petri dish, test tube, pot experiments and then under open field conditions at different crop growth stages of wheat. Results of petri dish, test tube and pot experiments showed positive effects of nanobiomass upto certain limits but affected negatively beyond 250 ppm. The results of field experiments showed that there were 55.55 and 68.75% increase in the crop growth rate of wheat in 2020 and 2021 by three applications of nanobiomass at 250 ppm compared to control. Similarly, 61.27 and 53.97% increase in the grain yield of wheat was recorded with nano-biomass application compared to control in 2020 and 2021 respectively. Similarly, there was 250% and 252% decrease in the proline accumulation where nano biomass was applied by three times at different growth stages of wheat as compared with control during 2020 and 2021 respectively which confirmed the presence of drought stress in control treatment but mitigation in treated plots. So, results of this study clearly exhibited that the application of this technology would be useful to mitigate drought stress under rainfed conditions and we can increase our wheat growth and production by following this technique under this changing climate. Moreover, the application of this technique is user and environment friendly. The study is also suggested to be evaluated for other crops.","Marta"

However, little information is available about how these alternatives affect soil textural properties responsible for soil fertility. This study evaluated the soil particle size distribution and volumetric water content after three years of consistent management in a raised bed system. There were four treatment systems in a dryland maize/soybean rotation on a silt loam soil (Oxyaquic Fraglossudalfs) that included: NT + CCs, conventional tillage (CT) + CCs, CT + winter weeds, and CT + bare soil in winter in northwest Mississippi. The NT + CC system retained 62% more coarse sand in the furrow than the other systems (2.1% compared to 1.3%; p = 0.02). Regardless of the location, the NT + CC system (2.5%) retained 39% more fine sand than the CT + CC system (1.8%; p = 0.01), suggesting that coarse and fine sands were being trapped in furrows combining NT + CC systems, minimizing their off-site transport. In furrows, CCs increased soil volumetric water content by 47% compared to other winter covers. In beds, NT + CCs increased bed water contents by 20% compared to CT + CCs (17.1 to 14.3%; p < 0.01). Implementing conservation alternatives may promote the retention of sand fractions in silty loam soils that are important in supporting soil fertility and crop sustainability.","Marta"

With growing human populations globally, alternative P sources are vitally important to ensure future food security. Precipitation of the mineral struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O) from wastewater could be a potential alternative fertilizer-P option from crop production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of chemically precipitated struvite (CPST), compared with triple superphosphate (TSP) and an unamended control (UC) treatment, and irrigation (irrigated and non-irrigated/dryland) on above- (dry matter, yield, and tissue-N, -P, and -Mg concentrations and uptake) and belowground (root tissue N, P, and Mg concentrations) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) response in a wheat-soybean, double-crop production system on a silt-loam soil (Aquic Fraglossudalfs) in eastern Arkansas. Soybean aboveground and wheat belowground Mg concentrations were 1.1 and 1.2 times, respectively, greater (p < .05) from CPST than from TSP, while soybean belowground Mg and wheat stem P concentrations were similar between CPST and TSP. Wheat stem Mg and belowground N concentrations were 1.1 times greater (p < .05) from TSP than from CPST. Soybean seed P and Mg concentrations were 1.2 and 1.1 times, respectively, greater (p < .05) under irrigated than under dryland management. Results substantiate the use of CPST as a potential alternative fertilizer-P and -Mg source on a silt-loam soil for crop production. Using wastewater-recovered nutrients in a production-scale setting may offset the need for energy-intensive commercial fertilizers to supply essential plant nutrients.","Marta"

Glyphosate resistance was confirmed in K. scoparia populations collected from sugarbeet fields in Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska, and Montana. Glyphosate resistance was also confirmed in K. scoparia accessions collected from wheat-fallow fields in Montana. All GR samples had increased EPSPS gene copy number, with median population values up to 11 from sugarbeet fields and up to 13 in Montana wheat-fallow fields.

A current deficiency is the lack of adequate comprehensive validations for long term crop sequences that capture the dynamics of soil and crop responses without resetting soil conditions, especially for soil mineral nitrogen (Min-N). This reduces confidence in the outcome of scenario analyses for proposed improvements in productivity and sustainability given the central role played by nitrogen (N) dynamics in both processes. We used data from a 30-year long-term experiment (LTE) to validate the APSIM model and achieved excellent predictions for soil and crop responses including the dynamics of Min-N without resetting. A critical step was to ensure that the parameters required for the pools of soil organic matter matched those measured at the site over the full rooting depth (1.6 m) rather than limiting measured values to surface layers and relying on default parameters in deeper layers. In subsequent scenario analyses of agronomic innovations including fallow weed control, earlier sowing and improved N fertiliser strategies, the validated model predicted potential increases in average annual productivity of 1.2 t ha-1 (30%), WUE of 2.0 kg ha-1 mm-1 (30%) and NUE of 13 kg kg-1 (21%) and reductions in average annual N leaching of 8 kg N ha-1 (-33%) and soil organic matter loss of 3.1 t ha-1 (31%) (0-10 cm) could be achieved with specific combinations of synergistic innovations previously investigated separately in shorter-term experiments. Our study represents a rare case of model validation capturing the dynamics of soil water, Min-N, biomass and grain yield in a long-term diverse crop sequence to provide confidence in scenario analyses of production and environmental consequences of agronomic innovations. LTEs provide a valuable resource for such validation, while conclusions drawn from simulation studies that lack comprehensive validation must be considered with caution.","Marta"

(A. ludoviciana) are extremely invasive weeds with strong competitive ability and multiple transmission routes. Both species can invade a variety of dryland crops, including wheat, corn, and beans. Asia, as the world's major food-producing continent, will experience significant losses to agricultural production if it is invaded by these weeds on a large scale. This study used the MaxEnt model and ArcGIS to map the distribution of suitable habitats of the two species in Asia under climate change conditions. The constructed model comprised four levels, with a total of 25 index-level indicator factors used to evaluate the invasion risk of the two species. The results showed that the distribution of suitable habitats for both Avena species was highly dependent on precipitation and temperature. Under climate warming conditions, although overall the total suitable area is predicted to decrease compared to the current period, there are still moderately or highly suitable areas. Asian countries need to provide early warning for areas with significant increases in moderate and highly suitable zones for these two species of weeds under the background of climate change. If there is already an invaded area or if the suitability of the original area is increased, this should be closely monitored, and control measures should be taken to prevent further spread and deterioration.","Marta"

Its infestation is Petrobia latens confined to relatively dry regions. It remains active during winter season with peak activity in March. In current study, mite population was recorded in wheat fields from 2004 to 2022 at Ludhiana, India. The population was recorded at 7 days interval, from 30 days after sowing till crop harvest and, correlated with meteorological data through multi-linear models fitted using the REG procedure in SAS model. In addition, periodic surveillance was also carried out in rainfed areas of Punjab-Himachal Pradesh border areas and field areas of Rajasthan. The results revealed that, in general, mite population starts increasing from January-February onwards, reached highest in March and, declined thereafter near crop harvest in April. The mite population showed a positive correlation with maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity and sunshine, and a negative correlation with rainfall. A distribution map of was prepared. The incidence of brown wheat mite was P. latens observed on other crops also, including spices, weeds and pulses. The natural enemies belonging to family Anystidae, Phytoseiidae grubs and adults of Coccinellidae were also recorded","Marta"

We sampled the seed bank of 47 conventionally managed cereal fields from two Mediterranean regions in Spain. In each field, three positions were selected: Margin, edge and core, and soil properties were measured for each position. Landscape structure was quantified for each field as the percentage of arable land in the surrounding 1 km radius circular sector. Seed bank diversity was characterized at the taxonomic (species richness, exponential Shannon index, and evenness) and functional levels (Rao's quadratic entropy index and four corner analysis). For functional diversity, eight functional traits related to the whole plant life cycle were considered. Results showed a slight response of increasing taxonomic diversity from the core of the fields to the margins. Functional diversity was extremely low, indicating high similarity among species in terms of functional traits. Species in the seed bank were mostly therophytes, shorter than the crop plants, small seeded, flowering between the herbicide application of late winter and crop harvest, and showed seed dispersal by gravity or wind. This trait syndrome allows persistence in intensively managed arable lands. The similarity between fields in terms of functional diversity of the seed bank and in species traits may suggest that the intensity of management practices was similar across the fields. Moreover, it emphasizes that an increase in landscape heterogeneity, if based on other intensively managed cropping systems, may not be sufficient to augment functional diversity of weed communities. Therefore, in these areas, the seed bank could restore weed taxonomic diversity following changes in management practices, but functional diversity would still remain limited.","Marta"

The reported benefits (improved ground cover, reduced nitrate leaching, increased soil organic matter among others) have prompted widespread interest in cover cropping in other agro-climatic zones, including Mediterranean environments such as southern Australia, where the wet, mild winters and hot dry summers are a stark contrast to temperate environments.OBJECTIVE: This review considers the reported benefits of cover crops in temperate environments in the context of cropping systems in the water-limited, Mediterranean climate in the grain-growing regions of southern Australia.METHODS: Published studies on cover cropping were critically assessed to evaluate whether the reported impacts may be relevant to Mediterranean-type climates.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Nitrate leaching is not generally problematic in southern Australian cropping systems due to low summer rainfall and high temperatures, and complete retention of crop stubbles can adequately protect the soil from erosion. Further, summer rainfall is low and sporadic which not only limits cover crop planting opportunities but means that water conserved over summer fallows contributes significantly to winter cash crop yield. Consequently, cover crop duration would need to be short (1-2 months) to balance the benefits of increased cover for water infiltration with transpiration loss during cover crop growth. Restricted cover crop biomass production due to water constraints and short fallow length will limit the potential value of the cover crop to increase soil organic matter, microbial activity, and biologically-fixed nitrogen contributions - all reported benefits for higher biomass cover crops in temperate environments. Appropriate tactical use of summer cover crops may arise in situations where (i) soil cover is reduced by winter crop failure or prolonged drought creating significant erosion risk, (ii) recalcitrant herbicide resistant weeds in winter crops require a chemical spring fallow and summer cover/forage crop, which could be grazed, (iii) full soil profiles at harvest and wet seasonal outlook provide opportunities for cover crop growth without significant pre-emptive competition, and (iv) sandy soil profiles with low water holding capacity combined with reliable winter rainfall minimise contributions of summer rainfall to winter crop yields. The value of more diverse cover crop species to soil health in cereal-brassica or cereal-brassica-legume cash crop rotations is not known.SIGNIFICANCE: The rationale for widespread summer cover crop use in southern Australia is currently not compelling without more evidence for the scale and mechanisms of the anticipated benefits.","Marta"

It is aggressively weedy in croplands, field-side ditches, wet areas and along roadsides, especially in slightly acidic, nitrogen-rich, clay-loam soils. In addition to interfering with crop growth, the weed causes dermatitis and eye irritation in humans, skin rashes and sour mouth in domesticated mammals, and off-flavours in cow's milk through forage contamination. Although A. cotula may be managed effectively with some broadleaf herbicides in cereal crops, it is much more difficult to manage in broadleaved crops and cover crops. In some regions, aggressive use of relatively few herbicides has selected for acetolactate synthase herbicide resistance in A. cotula. Therefore, A. cotula poses serious ecological and economic challenges in many regions. Despite this threat, the details of A. cotula biology and ecology in the context of environmental change remain relatively unknown. For example, the reason for the invasiveness of A. cotula remains uncertain, but is presumed to be due to abundant seed production, allelochemicals, mycorrhizal associations, minimal herbivory in invaded ranges, ability to attract generalist pollinators through an extended flowering period and adaptive capacity in a wide range of soil types and conditions. In this paper, we comprehensively review the literature and ongoing work on A. cotula and provide a research agenda to improve understanding and management of this species.","Marta"
126,NA,"not vetted","Beyond bird feed: proso millet for human health and environment.","Domesticated in 8000-10,000 BP in northern China, proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is the best adaptive rotational crop for semiarid central High Plains of the USA, where average annual precipitation is 356-407 mm. Proso millet has multiple benefits when consumed as human food. Proso millet is rich in minerals, dietary fiber, polyphenols, vitamins and proteins. It is gluten-free and therefore, ideal for the gluten intolerant people. Proso millet contains high lecithin which supports the neural health system. It is rich in vitamins (niacin, B-complex vitamins, folic acid), minerals (P, Ca, Zn, Fe) and essential amino acids (methionine and cysteine). It has a low glycemic index and reduces the risk of type-2 diabetes. Unfortunately, in the USA, it is mostly considered as bird feed, whereas it is mainly used as human food in many other countries. Besides human health benefits, proso millet has an impeccable environmental benefit. Proso millet possesses many unique characteristics (e.g., drought tolerance, short-growing season) which makes it a promising rotational crop for winter wheat-based dryland farming systems. Proso millet provides the most economical production system when used in a two years wheat/summer fallow cropping system in semiarid High Plains of the USA. It helps in controlling winter annual grass weeds, managing disease and insect pressure and preserving deep soil moisture for wheat. Proso millet can also be used as a rotational crop with corn or sorghum owing to its tolerance for atrazine, the primary herbicide used in corn and sorghum production systems. Proso millet certainly is a climate-smart, gluten-free, ancient, and small grain cereal, which is healthy to humans and the environment. The main challenge is to expand the proso millet market beyond bird feed into the human food industry. To overcome the challenge, unique proso millet varieties for human food and ready-to-use multiple food products must be developed. This requires successful collaboration among experts from diverse disciplines such as breeders, geneticists, food chemists and food industry partners. © 2017 by the authors.

127,NA,"not vetted","Effect of patch size on seed removal by harvester ants","The harvester ant Messor barbarus can be responsible for high weed seed losses in dry land cereals in Spain. Because weeds occur in patches, harvester ants have to be able to find and exploit patches. However, seed patches can differ in size and may, therefore, differ in the probability of being discovered and exploited. Here, 90 patches varying in size from 0.25 to 9m(2) were created in three 50x50m subareas in a cereal field. Oat seeds were sown as weed seed surrogates in the patches at 2000seedsm(-2). After 24h, those remaining were collected and the exploitation rate (the percentage of seeds removed per patch discovered by ants) was estimated. Harvester ant nests and the location of the seed patches were georeferenced and used to estimate distances between them. The patch encounter rate (the proportion of patches discovered by the ants) decreased slightly, but significantly, with decreasing patch size, though not the exploitation rate, which was lowest in the smallest patches (78-94%) and highest in the largest (99-100%). Seed patches that were not found or partially exploited were mostly located in subareas with a lower ant nest density or a longer distance away from the nearest nest than seed patches that were fully exploited. The results of this study indicate that the interaction between the spatial distribution of ant nests and the patchy distribution of seeds can create opportunities for seeds to be subjected to lower levels of predation.","Marta"

Objective or research question: This study aimed to answer the questions- 1. Do tillage practices, mulching and Sesbania alley -based food -fodder cropping system affect weed dynamics under rainfed agro-ecosystem? and 2. Is the productivity of a Sesbania alley -based rainfed food -fodder system affected by tillage practice, mulching or crop sequence? Methods: A four-year field experiment was conducted with Sesbania alley -based food -fodder systems (sorghum - chickpea; sorghum - barley; sorghum - mustard), and three tillage practices (conventional tillage; minimum tillage during rainy season - zero tillage during winter season; conventional tillage during rainy season - zero tillage during winter season) with and without mulch. Results: During the study period, conservation agricultural techniques resulted in a shift in weed flora in all Sesbania alley -based cropping systems. Grass, broadleaf, and total weed densities declined by 8-9%, 35-38%, and 11-13%, respectively, across diverse cropping systems from 2014 to 15; however, sedge population increased (13-29% increase) during the same period. Mulching practices considerably reduced sedge density compared to the without -mulch treatment in all the tillage combinations. The lowest total weed biomass was recorded for minimum tillage during the rainy season and zero tillage + mulching treatment (17 g m-2) during the winter season. Weed species abundance and dominance were greater in 2014, while the diversity and evenness of weed species were higher in 2016, which indicates a weed shift. Sesbania hedgerow + (sorghummustard) with conventional tillage during the rainy season and zero tillage during the winter season without mulching had the highest weed diversity index and evenness than that of other treatment combinations. The Sesbania dry matter (DM) yield was significantly higher by 13% and 11% in minimum tillage during the rainy season and zero tillage during the winter season with mulching compared to conventional tillage without mulch in 2015-16 and 2016-17, respectively. However, tillage and mulching had a significant effect on the grain and straw yields of winter crops. All the tillage practices with Sesbania mulching recorded higher grain and straw yields for winter crops compared to the un-mulched treatments. Conclusions: The innovative Sesbania alley -based rainfed food -fodder system, along with reduced tillage and mulching, improved productivity and altered weed dynamics. Implications or significance: The knowledge gathered on weed dynamics may aid in determining weed management tactics under conservation agricultural practices. Double cropping is possible without compromising fodder needs by employing suitable tillage and mulching procedures, as well as Sesbania alley -based cropping systems.","Marta"
129,NA,"not vetted","Rain, rain, gone away: decreased growing-season rainfall for the dryland cropping region of the south-west of Western Australia","The shift in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures in 1976 led to a change in rainfall for the broad-scale winter annual grain cropping and pasture region in the south-west of Western Australia (the WA wheatbelt). Agriculture in the eastern part the WA wheatbelt was particularly sensitive to the change in rainfall because it is a marginal area for agronomic production, with low rainfall before changes in sea surface temperature. A second shift in sea surface temperature occurred in 2000, but there has been no analysis of the resulting impact on rainfall in the eastern WA wheatbelt. An analysis of rainfall pre- and post-2000 was performed for sites in the eastern WA wheatbelt in three groups: 19 sites in the west, 56 central, and 10 east. The analysis found a decline in growing-season rainfall (i.e. April-October), especially during May-July, post-2000. Rainfall declines of 49.9 mm (west group), 39.1 mm (central group) and 28.0 mm (east group) represented respective losses of 20.1%, 17.4% and 14.2% of growing-season rainfall. Increases in out-of-season rainfall in the respective groups of 31.0, 33.6, and 50.7 mm (57.8%, 60.8% and 87.6%) meant that annual rainfall changes were smaller than growing-season losses. The west and central groups lost 17.5 and 6.16 mm annual rainfall, whereas the east group gained 15.6 mm. Analysis of wheat yield indicated reductions of 13.5% (west) and 9.90% (central) in the eastern WA wheatbelt; the small group of east sites had a potential yield gain of 8.9% arising from the increased out-of-season rainfall. Further, increased out-of-season rainfall will exacerbate weed and disease growth over the summer fallow.","Marta"

This research was needed to answer the economics of these various tillage systems and how the re-introduction of a single tillage changes the cost and revenue of long-term NT. An Economic analyses of these alternative tillage systems, based on long-term field research, is limited. The specific objective of this research was to quantify the relative eco-nomic advantages of various tillage systems (CT, RT, NT, and OT) in a wheat-sorghum-fallow (W-S-F) rotation in the central Great Plains. Results of two long-term field research studies conducted in western Kansas were used for this analysis. The first study was conducted from 2001 to 2018 to compare CT, RT, and NT systems and the second study from 2014 to 2018 at two locations to compare NT with OT. Results showed average NT sorghum yields were more than double the average yields of CT and 58 % greater than RT. There were no significant differences in wheat or sorghum yields between NT and OT. Total cost of production for the W-S-F system increased in the order NT>RT>CT. However, the NT system had the greatest average return, about $76 and $146 ha-1 greater than RT and CT, respectively. Net returns were not different between NT and OT. In support with our initial hypothesis, we concluded that a NT system has yield and profit advantages over RT and CT. And if a onetime OT is necessary in a long-term NT system, crop yields and return will not be significantly affected in the first 5 years after the OT.","Marta"

Direct AMS dates on rice and millet seeds, included together in a Bayesian model, suggests that sedentary agricultural occupation began ca. 2650 BCE, with cultivation of already domesticated rice (Oryza saliva), broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), and foxtail millet (Setaria italica). Soybean (Glycine cf. max) was also present and presumably cultivated, although it still resembles its wild progenitor in terms of seed size. Additional possible cultivars include melon (Cucumis melo) and an unknown Vigna pulse, while wild gathered resources include fruits and nuts, including hawthorn (Crateagus) and aquatic foxnut (Eutyale ferox). Weed flora suggests at least some rice was cultivated in wet (flooded or irrigated fields), while dryland weeds may derive from millet fields. This subsistence system persisted throughout the site's occupation, up to ca. 2050 BCE. These data provide secure evidence for the spread of Chinese Neolithic crops to Yunnan, and provide new evidence for reconstructing possible sources of cereal agriculture in mainland Southeast Asia.","Marta"

To improve crop productivity and to reduce N fertilizer rates, a 4-yr field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of leguminous green manure (GM) and N fertilizer on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth, yield, and economics on the Loess Plateau. Following a split-plot design, the main treatments included three legume species: Huai bean (Glycine ussuriensis Regel et Maack.), soybean [G. max (L.) Merr.], mung bean (Phaseolus radiatus L.), and summer fallow (as control treatment [CK]); The subtreatments included four N fertilizer rates that were applied to the wheat. Leguminous GM apparently improved wheat growth, productivity, and nutrient uptake compared to bare fallow, especially during a wet year. At least 2 yr and abundant rainfall are required for bettering the GM approaches. Incorporation of GM for 4 yrs could effectively reduce the N fertilizer rate for wheat by 33% (54 kg N ha(-1)), with even more potential during a wet year. High expenditures for field management and variable weather patterns led to few direct economic benefits of GM approaches. Huai bean is a more profitable legume species to be used as GM crops. The cultivation of leguminous GM during summer is a better option than bare fallow for sustaining wheat productivity, and decreasing the required N fertilizer rates not only on the Loess Plateau of China but also in the other similar dryland regions around the world.","Marta"

Merr.] rotations may prevent N loss and provide other ecosystem services but CC productivity in the western Corn Belt is limited by the short growing season. Our objective was to assess CC treatment and planting practice effects on CC biomass, spring soil nitrate concentrations, and soybean yield at two rainfed sites in eastern and one irrigated site in south-central Nebraska over 4 yr. Cover crop treatments (cereal rye [Secale cereale L.] [RYE] and a mix of rye, legume, and brassica species [MIX]) were planted by broadcast interseeding into corn stands in September (pre-harvest broadcast) or drilling after corn harvest (post-harvest drilled) and terminated 2 wk before planting soybean. Cover crop biomass and N uptake varied between years, but generally at the eastern sites, pre-harvest broadcasting produced more biomass than post-harvest drilling (1.64 and 0.79 Mg ha(-1), respectively) and had greater N uptake (37 and 24 kg ha(-1), respectively). At the south-central site, post-harvest drilling produced more than pre-harvest broadcasting (1.44 and 1.20 Mg ha(-1), respectively). RYE had more biomass than MIX (1.41 and 1.09 Mg ha(-1), respectively), but the same N uptake. Soil nitrate reductions after CC were small. In 3 of 12 site-years, soybean yielded less after pre-harvest CC. Yield reductions were not correlated to CC biomass, but were likely due to greater weed pressure. High CC productivity is necessary for high N uptake, and requires site-specific selection of planting practice and CC treatments.","Marta"

This paper presents the first such study for developed Neolithic and Chalcolithic Central Anatolia, exploring crop husbandry at the large (8 ha) early 6th millennium BC site of Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk West and the last phases of the preceding Neolithic Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk East, located on the western end of the Konya Plain, and the small 4th millennium sites of Camlibel Tarlasi (0.25 ha), located in the loop of the Kizilirmak river, and Kurucay Ho spacing diaeresis yuk (similar to 1 ha), located on the shore of Lake Burdur. The results reveal the mosaic nature of Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk cultivation; the complex ecosystem, naturally N-15 enriched, was additionally anthropogenically improved, while inhabitants also chose to cultivate barley in drier conditions to the wheats and pulses. The smaller, Late Chalcolithic site of Camlibel Tarlasi cultivated each individual crop species in variable conditions instead of selecting a specific species for cultivation in drier or wetter conditions. Each single species was cultivated in conditions with a wide range of water availabilities while receiving low-level manure application. Variation in water availability is possibly a consequence of the variable topography surrounding the site, with the hills potentially used for cultivation, providing a wide range of conditions due to their slope. Functional weed ecology complements the isotopic data, indicating the wider range of cultivation intensities surrounding Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk West, compared with more consistent, narrower ranges of growing conditions at Camlibel Tarlasi and Kurucay Ho spacing diaeresis yuk. Settlement date, site size and environment seem to be key contributing factors shaping the method used to cultivate crops at these Chalcolithic sites. The larger, earlier community of Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk West, located in a complex riverine ecosystem around the dryland anabranching channels of the Cars , amba river, cultivated species in different conditions and maintained a range of crop husbandry intensities, potentially reflecting differential access to limited resources. The smaller Late Chalcolithic sites, with communities consisting of one household to several households and located in less complex ecosystems with higher precipitation, maintained more stable crop growing conditions and management intensities. This is plausibly a consequence of equal access and sharing of critical resources for crop cultivation, such as labour, manure and land, coupled with the adequate precipitation rates.","Marta"

A single application of a high rate of composted cattle manure (compost) may help to address these issues. To conserve compost-associated benefits and to prevent compost-amended soils from weed infestation, spring planting of cover crops has been recommended. The objective of this study was to evaluate the legacies of a single application of compost (0, 15, 30, and 45 Mg ha-1) and annual cover crop planting in the fallow phase on soil moisture, nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and plant-available phosphorus (AP) 3-7 years after application. Results suggest no synergy between compost and cover crops, but that compost alone can improve soil health. The highest rate of compost showed elevated levels of plant-available N, dissolved organic carbon, and AP in the 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm soil profiles throughout the duration of the study (2018-2022). Soil organic C and total N remained elevated at both soil profile depths when measured in 2019. However, wheat grain yield and protein were not affected by these improvements to soil health at this time. A single application of compost at a rate of 45 Mg ha-1 was sufficient to increase soil health and plant-available nutrients over the 5-year study period but did not increase crop yield. Growing cover crops did not negatively affect crop yield.","Marta"

Therefore, a three-year study was carried at two hilly sites (Sartori and Ottina) in Northern Italy to evaluate the impact of two novel winter cover crop terminations (interrow rolling, R, and sub-row mulching, SRM) on vine physiology and performance as compared to standard practice, either alternate tilled-grassed interrow and/or green manuring (GM). Moreover, at the Ottina site, cover crop sowing used two different seed mixtures: the cereal based Humusfert (HF) and the legume based Nitrofert (NF). Each season, in summer, soil and vine water status were measured as soil saturation degree (theta s/theta sat), pre-dawn (Psi PD) and midday leaf water potential (Psi MD), whereas gas exchange was monitored as leaf assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (gs). At both sites, for data pooled over years, the amount of rolled dry biomass was lower than 650 g m-2 and R did not result in any significant variation of water status, gas exchange and vine performance versus the standard practice. Vice versa, at the Sartori site, the amount of mulched biomass under the row was quite abundant (1.517 g m-2 dry weight) and effective for weed suppression. SRM also maintained less negative Psi PD in the warmest part of 2022 and 2023 seasons without, however, greatly impacting leaf water status, gas exchange and vine performances. At Ottina, SRM assured, for data pooled over years, higher total soluble solids (TSS) and malic acid and lower pH than R suggesting that sugar accumulation and acid degradation were partially decoupled. At the same site, NF allowed to increase yield without any concurrent change in vigor with a consequent ripening delay in terms of lower TSS, pH and anthocyanins, and higher tartaric acid at harvest, a sought effects under a global warming scenario. It is also practically relevant that HF lowered berry [K] significantly vs. NF suggesting that it might be used as an additional control tool to limit K accumulation into the berries and, eventually, wine pH. Overall, while SRM had better performance than R in terms of weed suppression, soil water status and berry ripening, results can vary as a function of the type of seed mixture which, in turn, closely interacts with specific environmental conditions.","Marta"

Field experiments were conducted at two different locations during two (2006/07 and 2007/08) and three (from 2005/06 to 2007/08) growing seasons. In both locations, 500 seeds of each Phalaris species were sown each growing season, simulating rain-fed cereal field conditions. In addition, the models were validated with three, four and eight independent experiments for P. brachystachys, P. minor and P. paradoxa, respectively. The emergence period of the three Phalaris species lasted between 31 and 48 days after sowing (DAS), showing two main flushes. The three cardinal points for parametric and non-parametric models were established to be between -1 degrees C and 1 degrees C for base temperature, between 9.8 degrees C and 11.8 degrees C for optimal temperature and between 21.2 degrees C and 23.4 degrees C for ceiling temperature; base water potential was estimated to be between -1 and -1.1 MPa.

Meanwhile, increasing common crop diseases, such as yellow rust, one of the most important pathogens affecting global wheat production has been detected in the area in recent decades. However, the impact of O3 on the occurrence and impact of fungal diseases is scarcely understood. A close-to-field-conditions assay (Open Top Chamber facility) situated in a Mediterranean cereal rainfed farming area was carried out to study the impact of increasing O3 levels and N-fertilization on spontaneous fungal outbreaks in wheat. Four O3-fumigation levels reproducing pre-industrial to future pollutant atmospheres with additional 20 and 40 nL L-1 over the ambient levels were considered (7 h-mean ranging from 28 to 86 nL L-1). Two top N-fertilization supplementations (100 and 200 kg ha-1) were nested within the O3 treatments; foliar damage, pigment content and gas exchange parameters were measured. Pre-industrial natural background O3 levels strongly favored the yellow rust infection, where the O3-polluted levels currently observed at the farm highly benefited the crop, mitigating the presence of rust by 22 %. However, future expected high O3-levels neutralized the beneficial infection-controlling effect by inducing early wheat senescence, decreasing the chlorophyll index of the older leaves by up to 43 % under the higher O3 exposure. Nitrogen promoted the rust infection by up to 49.5 % without interacting with the O3-factor. Achieving future air quality standards might require considering new varietal improvement programs, to be able to adapt crops to an increased pathogen tolerance without requiring the assistance provided by O3-pollution.","Marta"

The soil analysis was conducted in 2019 and 2020 from CT and NT treatments from a long-term study conducted near Hays, KS, with N fertilizer rates of 0, 45, 90, and 134 kg N ha(-1). Averaged across years, SOC in the top 0-to-5-cm soil depth under NT was 19% greater than that measured in CT, but SOC was not different between the two tillage practices in the 5-to-15-cm depth. The SOC concentration increased by 24-25% within the top 0-to-5-cm soil depth with increasing N rate from 0 to 90 or 134 kg N ha(-1). Soil pH declined at rates of 0.004 and 0.007 for every kg ha(-1) increase in N rate for CT and NT treatments within the 0-to-5-cm soil depth. Nitrate-N concentration under NT at the top 0-5 cm soil was 55% more than CT but ammonium-N concentration was unaffected by tillage or N rate. Phosphorus (P), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) concentrations measured in the top 0-5 cm were 24, 34, and 33% greater in soils under NT compared with CT, respectively. Findings of the study suggest pH and SOC stratification in long-term NT systems can affect soil macro- and micronutrient concentrations and availability in dryland crop production systems.","Marta"

However, there is limited understanding of the impacts of ST on soil microbiome and their associated soil processes, particularly in dryland agriculture. This study aims to quantify the effect of one-off ST - after three years - on soil microbiomes and functions in a long-term no-till farming system under crop stubble and fertilizer management practices. The results showed that ST had marginal effects on microbial richness and diversity, enzyme activities, and catabolic function, but significantly affected the abundance of some microbial taxa (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicmbia, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) that are relevant to carbon (C) degradation. Stubble retention, regardless of tillage and fertilizer management, mainly increased the abundance of copiotrophs such as Proteobacteria (e.g., Rhizobiales) and Actinobacteria (e.g., Streptomyces and Micromonosporaceae), and affected Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Among the management practices, stubble retention was the main factor that contributed to increased richness and diversity of the soil bacterial and fungal community. Supplementary fertilizer application, regardless of tillage and stubble management had minimal impact on bacterial and fungal richness and diversity, enzyme activity and catabolic function. The variation in bacterial community structure was influenced mainly by soil pH (c.a. 10%), while only a small but significant effect (< 7%; P = 0.001) was attributed to tillage and stubble management. Wheat grain yields ranged between 5 and 5.3 t ha(-1) and were not affected by tillage, stubble, nor fertilizer management practices. Similarly, these management practices did not influence total soil C or nitrogen concentrations. Our findings show that strategic tillage, when used to address specific constraints in no-till systems in dryland agriculture, does not have a significant effect on total soil C, microbial ecology nor catabolic function.","Marta"

A nine-location field experiment was established across Spain where a total of 400 A. sterilis seeds per location were sowed in four replicates in autumn 2016 to monitor the emergence during two growing seasons in dryland conditions. The data were used to test the prediction ability of previously published thermal (TT) and hydrothermal time (HTT) models and to develop new models, if required. Overall, the average percentage of emergence was 30% during the first season and 21% during the second season. In both seasons, the main emergence flush occurred between November and February. According to the phenological stage, A. sterilis achieved the tillering earlier in southern sites, between November 25 and the end of December, compared with northern sites, where this stage was reached at the end of January. The newly developed model described the emergence with precision, using three cardinal temperatures to estimate the TT. The three cardinal points were established at -1.0, 5.8, and 18.0 C for base (T (b)), optimum (T (o)), and ceiling temperature (T (c)), while the base water potential (psi(b)) was established at -0.2 MPa for the HTT estimation. This study contributes to improving prediction of the emergence of A. sterilis and provides knowledge for decision support systems (DSS) for the control of this weed.","Marta"

Genetic knowledge of metribuzin tolerance in wheat is needed to develop new cultivars for the industry. Here, we investigated gene effects for metribuzin tolerance in nine crosses of wheat by partitioning the means and variances of six basic generations from each cross into their genetic components to assess the gene action governing the inheritance of this trait. Metribuzin tolerance was measured by a visual senescence score 21 days after treatment. The wheat 90 K iSelect SNP genotyping assay was used to identify the distribution of alleles at SNP sites in tolerant and susceptible groups.Results: The scaling and joint-scaling tests indicated that the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat was adequately described by the additive-dominance model, with additive gene action the most significant factor for tolerance. The potence ratio for all the crosses ranged between - 1 and + 1 for senescence under metribuzin-treated conditions indicating a semi-dominant gene action in the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat. The number of segregating genes governing metribuzin tolerance was estimated between 3 and 15. The consistent high heritability range (0.82 to 0.92) in F5-7 generations of Chuan Mai 25 (tolerant) x Ritchie (susceptible) cross indicated a significant contribution of additive genetic effects to metribuzin tolerance in wheat. Several genes related to photosynthesis (e.g. photosynthesis system II assembly factor YCF48), metabolic detoxification of xenobiotics and cell growth and development (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, glycosyltransferase, ATP-binding cassette transporters and glutathione peroxidase) were identified on different chromosomes (2A, 2D, 3B, 4A, 4B, 7A, 7B, 7D) governing metribuzin tolerance.Conclusions: The simple additive-dominance gene effects for metribuzin tolerance will help breeders to select tolerant lines in early generations and the identified genes may guide the development of functional markers for metribuzin tolerance.","Marta"

In order to determine the benefits of using cover crops on soil fertility and biodiversity, an investigation with different combinations of legumes and oat has been conducted during 2014-2015 in Chania, Greece, in a low tree density rain-fed olive orchard covered dominantly by Oxalis pescaprae weed. The treatments were: natural vegetation, bare soil, only oats, only Vicia sativa, mixture of four legumes with oats and mixture of five legumes with oats. Seed emergence and soil cover was monitored and soil was monthly sampled at three depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) for analysis. During plant growth, significant fluctuations in soil NO3-N and NH4-N content were recorded. Similarly, soil CO2 emissions increased with plant growth and air temperature raise. Sowing cover crop mixtures is a promising soil management practice to increase soil fertility and enrich plant and microbial biodiversity in olive orchards especially when dominated by Oxalis pes-caprae a very aggressive weed in many Mediterranean areas.","Marta"

Variability in nutrient acquisition strategies between crop genotypes may confer advantages under different soil health contexts and could be important for crop selection and breeding, but crop response under field conditions remains unexplored. We investigated the ability of different genotypes of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to access nitrogen (N) from newly added cover crop residues in two soils with contrasting levels of SOM and biological activity. We planted three previously characterized wheat genotypes in a long-term dryland compost amendment field trial: 1) Byrd (modern, deep roots, low exudation), 2) Cheyenne (historic, drought susceptible, intermediate exudation), and 3) Snowmass (modern, drought-susceptible, high exudation). 15N-labelled cover crop residue was added to each plot and traced into wheat tissue. In the low SOM soil, the high exudate genotype Snowmass and historic genotype Cheyenne took up the most residue-derived N (6.4-8.1 kg N ha-1) compared to the low-exudate genotype Byrd (4.4 kg N ha-1), suggesting a strong exudate effect in the more carbon-limited soil. However, in the high SOM soil, the low-exudate, deep rooted genotype, Byrd, took up the most residue N (4.6 kg N ha-1 vs. 2.8 and 3.3 hg N ha-1 for Cheyenne and Snowmass, respectively), which indicated higher native N cycling activities and greater importance of drought resistance. Enzyme activity, inorganic N, and microbial communities were not influenced by genotype, though did show strong effects of compost application legacy. Our results show that belowground allocation strategies that favor microbial stimulation may be less successful under water limitation, especially when high native SOM and biological activity can support miner-alization of residue N without added investment in root inputs. Increased soil health through SOM-building management likely enhances nutrient cycling, and may better support root strategies that invest less in micro-bial stimulation in favor of other limiting resources.","Marta"

The objective of this paper is to present a new mechanical planter (Gangaria) for the combined application of seeds and soil amendments (mineral fertilizer, compost, etc.), and to assess the effects of using this planter in pearl millet on labor use, yield and economic return. The labor study showed that the mechanized application of seeds and compost reduced time use by a factor of more than six. The on-station experiments were completely randomized experiments with six replications and six treatments: T0 (control), T1 (0.3 g NPK hill(-1)), T2 (25 g compost hill(-1)), T3 (25 g compost + 0.3 g NPK hill(-1)), T4 (50 g compost hill(-1)) and T5 (50 g compost + 0.3 g NPK hill(-1)). Treatments T1 to T5 were sown by the planter with seeds that were primed in combination with coating of seeds with a fungicide/insecticide. The treatment T5 increased grain yield and economic return compared to the control by 113% and 106%, respectively. The advantages for farmers using this approach of agricultural intensification are timelier sowing of dryland cereal crops, easy application of organic fertilizer and more precise delivery of input, thereby making this cropping system more productive and less vulnerable to drought.","Marta"

Before availability of herbicides, the first tillage during fallow was timed to kill weeds, but now the optimum timing for tillage depends only on the interplay of evaporation and infiltration of rain. The goal is to maximize total root zone water storage and seed-zone water at seeding time. Our objective was to measure the effect of delaying soil mulch creation progressively later in the spring and summer on weed-free fallow for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Mediterranean inland Pacific Northwest drylands of the United States. Over a period of six years and a total of 12 site-years, four to seven tillage timings were compared to an untilled treatment. Soil water was measured at seeding time in the seed zone and total root zone. Seed-zone water and total stored water produced by different tillage timings was surprisingly constant, with few statistically significant or substantial differences. On average, only 2% of stored water was lost in the top 1.0 m of soil over 80 days during the hot, dry period towards the end of fallow. Responses to late spring rain could be seen, and tillage near the end of June (early summer) often produced maximum soil water content.","Marta"

Genetic knowledge of metribuzin tolerance in wheat is needed to develop new cultivars for the industry. Here, we evaluated metribuzin tolerance in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population derived from Synthetic W7984 and Opata 85 over two consecutive years to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to the trait. Herbicide tolerance was measured by two chlorophyll traits, SPAD chlorophyll content index (CCI) and visual senescence score (SNS). The markers associated with major QTL from Synthetic W7984, positively contributing to reduced phytotoxic effects under herbicide treatment were validated in two F-3/4 recombinant inbred populations developed from crosses of Synthetic W7984xWestonia and Synthetic W7984xLang.ResultsComposite interval mapping (CIM) identified four QTL, two on chromosome 4A and one each on chromosomes 2D and 1A. The chromosomal position of the two QTL mapped on 4A within 10cM intervals was refined and validated by multiple interval mapping (MIM). The major QTL affecting both measures of tolerance jointly explained 42 and 45% of the phenotypic variation by percentage CCI reduction and SNS, respectively. The identified QTL have a pure additive effect. The metribuzin tolerant allele of markers, Xgwm33 and Xbarc343, conferred lower phytotoxicity and explained the maximum phenotypic variation of 28.8 and 24.5%, respectively. The approximate physical localization of the QTL revealed the presence of five candidate genes (ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, oxidoreductase (rbcS), glycosyltransferase, serine/threonine-specific protein kinase and phosphotransferase) with a direct role in photosynthesis and/or metabolic detoxification pathways.ConclusionMetribuzin causes photo-inhibition by interrupting electron flow in PSII. Consequently, chlorophyll traits enabled the measure of high proportion of genetic variability in the mapping population. The validated molecular markers associated with metribuzin tolerance mediating QTL may be used in marker-assisted breeding to select metribuzin tolerant lines. Alternatively, validated favourable alleles could be introgressed into elite wheat cultivars to enhance metribuzin tolerance and improve grain yield in dryland farming for sustainable wheat production.","Marta"

Can we do it better?","'Translational research' became an increasingly common term when it was realised that much agriculturally inspired basic research failed to contribute to the improvement of crops. Most of the failure has come from laboratory-based attempts to ameliorate abiotic stresses. Dealing with biotic stress has been much more successful; the control of pests and weeds is often enabled by transforming crops with single genes, for such genes have little or no influence on a crop's metabolism. By contrast, abiotic stress varies with the weather; i.e. crops respond systemically, over a range of levels of organisation (e.g. cells, tissues, organs), with many feedbacks and feedforwards. Drought is the most pervasive form of abiotic stress. There are 4600 papers that have searched, ineffectively, for 'drought resistance', a term that usually defies useful definition. By contrast, dealing with a measured, limited water supply (e.g. seasonal rainfall), rather than with 'drought', has effectively increased water-limited yield through agronomic innovation based on improving water-use efficiency. 'Salt tolerance' has similar difficulties; nevertheless, physiological knowledge has revealed effective single genes, in contrast to the failures of empirical gene prospecting. Another important goal has been to increase potential crop yield by exploring mechanistic opportunities to improve photosynthetic efficiency. These attempts have not, so far, succeeded, perhaps because they have rarely broached physiological responses beyond carbon balance, such as metabolic responses to environmental challenges that may affect meristematic development. A major reason for the predominant failure of translational research from laboratory to field is that the peer-review system is too narrow; i.e. reviewers have the same backgrounds as the authors. Effective translation will require the addition of reviewers who can assess the pathway from laboratory to field.","Marta"

This has meant that, in recent years, there have been progressive flora changes in farming systems traditionally implemented in the Alentejo region. The present work has analyzed the weed flora in an early stage of these changes, and the impact of environmental factors on the distribution of natural vegetation under Mediterranean climate conditions in the influence area of Alqueva. In 2007, 105 floristic surveys were carried out in autumn-winter crop plots or other soil use, and 264 species were identified. Families with higher expression were: Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Fabaceae. Only three species have been identified in more than half of farms, Avena sterilis, Phalaris minor and Lolium rigidum and they were part of the 15 species that revealed high and very high infestation degrees. Soil texture and extractable phosphorus have been determined as active ecological factors, according to the method of ecological profiles and Mutual Information. Therefore, these factores were those with the greatest influence on the species distribution. L. rigidum distribution showed to be associated with medium soil texture and A. sterilis distribution also showed to be associated with medium and fine soil texture soils, without showing ecological preference by extractable phosphorus. The distribution of P. minor was not related to the soil texture but showed preference for soils with medium phosphorus content.","Marta"

Under this production system, speed of germination, field emergence, and crop yield depend prominently on rice seed vigor. We hypothesized that seed priming can enhance rice seed vigor and agronomic performance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of GA(3) and wood vinegar seed priming on seed vigor, seedling performance, and grain yield in farmer's fields. The experimental design was a split-split plot with four replications and planted in Thailand between April to December 2013 and 2014. Two rice cultivars (KDML 105 and RD6) were main plots; two planting methods (broadcast and row) were sub-plots, and three seed priming treatments (GA(3), wood vinegar, and untreated control) were sub-sub-plots. Seed priming enhanced speed of germination and final germination percentage under both laboratory and field condition. However, soil moisture availability during flowering and seed formation significantly affected agronomic performance. Wood vinegar-primed seeds had greater shoot growth and plant population at maturity, while GA3-primed seed had more rapid germination. Yield-elated agronomic performance characteristics of tillers plant(-1) and yield in ton ha(-1) were significantly higher for primed seed, and weed biomass was significantly reduced in 2013. Here, we show for the first time that wood vinegar is a sustainable alternative to chemicals for seed priming. Also, when water is available during flowering and seed development, wood vinegar priming increases grain yield and reduces weed pressure.","Marta"

During this period, the middle section of the eastern Taihang Mountain served as both a agricultural and animal husbandry transition zone and also a key passageway connecting the Central Plains with northern ethnic groups. However, the agricultural development in this area during this time remains unclear. This study analyzed 67 flotation samples from the Ximufo site (3572-2873 cal. BP) and the Zhongshan-Gulingshou sites (2515-2224 cal.BP), identifying 8,026 and 3,348 charred seeds, respectively. The results revealed crops such as foxtail millet (Setaria italica), broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), wheat (Triticum aestivum), soybean (Glycine max), and rice (Oryza sativa) with foxtail millet dominating (ubiquity >87 %). Non-crop remains included fruits (e.g., walnut, prunus, peach, jujube, melon seeds, plum, and kiwi), weeds, and spices, with forage grasses constituting over 74 % of weed remains, indicating significant animal husbandry. The delta N-15 values of foxtail millet decreased from 4.82 +/- 1.16 parts per thousand in the Warring States period to 2.56 +/- 0.69 parts per thousand in the Shang Dynasty, suggesting intensive application of organic fertilizers for farmland management in the eastern foothills of Taihang Mountain during the Warring States Period. Our results may not only help fill the knowledge gaps on subsistence economy and farmland management in this region, but also deepen our understanding of the spread of dryland agriculture and its relationship with environment and human ecological adaptation.","Marta"

With wheat yield gaps typically > 1.7 t/ha or 50% of the water-limited yield, it is important to investigate the degree to which this gap may be attributable to (rational) subprofit-maximising input levels in response to risk and risk aversion in many major grain-growing regions, particularly those with lower and more variable rainfall. Here, we use a set of 14 case study sites across the Australian wheatbelt to examine the risk-return profile of several agronomic management practices and show the extent to which the farmers' risk attitude determines their decision-making. Using a novel profit-risk-utility framework that incorporates crop simulation, probability theory, finance techniques and risk-aversion analysis, we were able to better demonstrate how farmers might select practices that manage economic risk across sites ranging from low to high rainfall. Results varied with risk preference and yield potential. However, there are real opportunities to close the yield gap by adopting non-limiting or near non-limiting nitrogen fertiliser practices and controlling fallow weeds. We show for the first time that yields associated with current best practice can be surpassed for most levels of risk aversion by adopting an emergent practice of optimising the site-specific time of sowing and matching variety to time of sowing. For some sites and risk profiles, the emerging best practice package which includes additional N fertiliser is also profitable under risk. We also propose a modified integrated framework for yield gaps. Here, we distinguish allocative input constrains due to risk aversion from those due to access to resources, and we account for an innovation gap where the current agronomic frontier is shifted upwards by growers successfully, implementing new technologies that are not yet part of current best practice.","Marta"

However, large and interdisciplinary archaeobotanical data sets are still scarce, which restricts the understanding of the subsistence of this cultural group. This paper presents a reconstruction of the vegetation, an analysis of human impact and a reconstruction of plant exploitation at the Vlaardingen site of Hekelingen III (2900-2500 BC). The analysis is based on an unusually large data set of four pollen sequences and more than 100 macroremain samples, supported by wood and charcoal data.The pollen data allows a reconstruction of the vegetation before, during and after the Vlaardingen occupation, and shows that human impact was very modest. The macroremain data indicates that there is evidence of emmer wheat, naked barley and flax. Arable weed analysis provides indications of an import of naked barley during at least one occupation phase, which corresponds with the restricted palynological evidence of human impact. In addition, there is plenty of evidence for the exploitation of wild fruits, such as hazelnuts, acorns, crab apples, and water chestnuts, and possibly root tubers of Ficaria verna.Despite indications of long-lasting occupation and a large variety of activities at Hekelingen III, the evidence of the consumption of agricultural products rather than their production and of the collection of a wide range of fruits fits very well with further indications of hunting, fishing and fowling and the absence of heavy, permanent structures. Moreover, the site can be seen as being part of a settlement system in which also other Vlaardingen sites played a role, such as the nearby site of Hellevoetsluis, where permanent occupation was verified and crops were locally cultivated.

Early vigour, defined as the rapid development of leaf area in early developmental stages, is reported to contribute to stronger plant vitality, which, in turn, can enhance resilience to erratic drought periods. Furthermore, early vigour improves weed competitiveness and nutrient uptake. Here, two sets of a multi-reference nested association mapping (MR-NAM) population of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum L.) were used to investigate early vigour in a rain-fed field environment for 3 years, and additionally assessed under controlled conditions in a greenhouse experiment. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from red/infrared light reflectance was used to quantify early vigour in the field, revealing a correlation (p < 0.05; r = 0.39) between the spectral measurement and the length of the second leaf. Under controlled environmental conditions, the measured projected leaf area, using a green-pixel counter, was also correlated to the leaf area of the second leaf (p < 0.05; r = 0.38), as well as to the recorded biomass (p < 0.01; r = 0.71). Subsequently, genetic determination of early vigour was tested by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the proxy traits, revealing 42 markers associated with vegetation index and two markers associated with projected leaf area. There are several quantitative trait loci that are collocated with loci for plant developmental traits including plant height on chromosome 2D (log(10) (P) = 3.19; PVE = 0.035), coleoptile length on chromosome 1B (-log(10) (P) = 3.24; PVE = 0.112), as well as stay-green and vernalisation on chromosome 5A (-log(10) (P) = 3.14; PVE = 0.115).","Marta"

However, cattle (Bos taurus) could potentially degrade soil physical properties by increasing compaction and reducing water infiltration in no-tillage (NT) systems. Minimum tillage (MT) may help correct some of these potential soil quality concerns. The objective of this study was to quantify MT effects on soil properties, forage mass, and weeds compared to NT in a grazed winter triticale [xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus (Secale x Triticum)] annual forage system from 2020 to 2022 near Jetmore, KS. The experiment had two tillage treatments, NT and MT (sweep plow to a depth of 5-13 cm twice during summer fallow), in a grazed continuous winter triticale cropping system. Bulk density was greater in June, pre-till (1.31 g cm-3), compared to August, post-till (1.23 g cm-3), across tillage treatments. The mean weight diameter of dry aggregates decreased, and wind-erodible fraction increased with MT. Across years, the mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates was greater with NT compared to MT. The SOC stocks did not differ between tillage practices near the soil surface, but MT increased SOC at the 5- to 15-cm depth. Nitrate (NO3-N) concentration was 28% higher with MT compared to NT across depths at the August sampling time. Soil pH was slightly lower in NT (5.81) compared to MT (5.94). Penetration resistance was high due to frequently dry soil conditions, but there were no differences between tillage systems. Early-season forage biomass was greater in MT compared to NT in one out of two seasons. Our findings suggest that MT could be used to mitigate adverse effects of grazing on soil bulk density in NT systems but could cause short-term decreases in dry and wet aggregate stability and increased wind-erodible fraction.Minimum tillage (MT) decreased mean weight diameter of dry aggregates and increased wind erodibility. The mean weight diameter of water-stable aggregates was greater with no-tillage (NT) compared to MT. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks did not differ with tillage near the surface, but SOC with MT was greater than NT in the 5-15 cm. There were no differences in penetration resistance between tillage systems. MT increased early-forage biomass in one out of two seasons compared to NT.","Marta"

However, this technique introduces other challenges, such as furrow runoff and soil erosion, which contribute to the degradation of ridge/bed soil quality, fertilizer loss, and transport of agroecological pollutants. Therefore, this study explores a hybrid variable flux irrigation (VFI) model as a decision support tool to mitigate these limitations by controlling soil anoxia and runoff in furrow-irrigated rice after straw incorporation. The approach integrates the Hydrus 2D/3D with optimal loop controllers to adjust pump operations based on specific soil moisture levels, variable flux, and furrow water flow depths. Experimental validation and a field case study were conducted in Babaiqiao, Nanjing City, China, where rotary straw mixing and furrow-ridge layouts were applied alongside dry rice seeding and soil hydraulic experiments. The performance indicators of the Hydrus 2D/3D variable flux demonstrated reliable simulation of lateral wetting rates and soil moisture content with R-2 of 0.79 and 0.89, corresponding RMSE values of 7.90 % and 7.60 %, and MRE values of 1.85 m/day and 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The VFI model proved effective, indicating that the optimal irrigation schedule consisted of three distinct supply regimes. During each cycle, the pump operated intermittently, running for approximately 2.66 hours. VFI led to a 33 % reduction in pumping energy costs while simultaneously mitigating soil anoxia and furrow runoff, thus a potential to reduce the environmental footprint of rice-wheat rotations. Although rice yields under drilled seeding were reduced by 9.56 % compared to flood irrigation due to heavy weed infestation, the VFI model provides valuable insights for promoting straw incorporation and implementing practical solutions that support optimal water utilization and sustainable productivity.","Marta"

We collected 155 releves in fields located in the Guelmim province comprising three agroecosystem types: Oases, terraced and floodplain fields (fa & iuml;d). We found 221 vascular plant species including seven regional endemics and one nationally very rare species. Using TWINSPAN, we identified three plant communities, each restricted to a specific agroecosystem type, displaying differences in species composition, floristic status, life-form and biogeographical spectra. Oasis vegetation had the highest overall number of species, terraced fields had the highest diversity, and therophytes were dominant across all communities, with fa & iuml;ds being the most therophyte-rich. The pan-Mediterranean chorotype dominated all three community types. Apophytes dominated, particularly in fa & iuml;d and terraced fields, surpassing oasis fields rich in ruderals. We found that traditional cereal agroecosystems in southern Morocco harbor species-rich segetal plant communities created by habitat-based land-use systems. Our results highlight the significance of agricultural practices and local abiotic factors in shaping the agroecosystems, which are adapted to arid environments and sensitive to environmental and social changes.","Marta"

Experiments were conducted at two no-till farms, located in Almota, WA, and Genesee, ID, in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest from 2016 to 2018. The experiment comprised two varieties (Havener and Julie), employed N rates of 0, 62, 95, 129, and 162 kg N ha(-1), and seeding rates of 250, 310, and 375 seeds/m(-2). Increased N fertilization rate was shown to significantly increase all response variables, except beta-glucan content of the variety Julie, days to heading, test weight, and percent plump and thin kernels. Increased N fertilization resulted in higher mean grain yield of Havener and Julie in both Almota and Genesee up to 95 kg N ha(-1). Havener had higher yields (3,908 kg N ha(-1)) than Julie (3,099 kg N ha(-1)) across locations and years. Julie had higher beta-glucan (8.2%) and protein (12.6%) content compared to Havener (beta-glucan = 6.6%; protein = 9.1%). Our results indicate that beta-glucan content is associated with genotype, environmental, and agronomic factors in dryland cropping systems of the Palouse.","Marta"

Millets and sorghum are increasingly recommended as alternatives to maize in addressing these issues, yet there are no studies comparing the environmental impacts of food-crop millets and sorghum with maize, under sustainable management in Mediterranean area. Objective: The present study examined for the first time the environmental and economic impacts, as well as agronomic performances, of rainfed cultivated proso millet, sorghum and maize over a three-year period under challenging climatic conditions in Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. Methods: Different kinds of trials were realized during three years of experimentation in one location in Ravenna province. The first trial aimed to compare proso millet, sorghum and maize agronomical performances and water use efficiency in a low-input system. The second trial aimed to compare soil fertility and biodiversity impacts of two different agronomical management systems (low-input and high input) for the summer crops previously described. Soil basic fertility parameters were monitored and ground dwelling arthropods were collected and analyzed using pitfall traps. The last trial of this study intended to evaluate the environmental and economic performances of the previous cereal crops cultivated in the low-input and high-input systems, applying the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methodologies. Results: Both organic sorghum and millet showed high potential as viable summer-crop alternatives, not only to organic maize, based on yield, water use efficiency, disease tolerance and weed competition, but also to conventional maize, based on reduced environmental and economic impacts. Positive land impacts including improved beneficial arthropod abundances and preserved soil fertility were evident under organic management. In fact, the comparative LCA and LCC, carried out with primary data from conventionally cultivated maize and sorghum within central-north Italy and the organic experimental field under investigation, showed that the Global Warming and Eutrophication Potential, were comparable between the organically cultivated crops and significantly lower than conventional maize and sorghum. Conclusions: The results highlighted the potential of sorghum and millet cultivation as rainfed summer-crop alternative to maize in climate-change context, especially in low-input agronomical systems. In particular, under rainfed, organic management over three years, proso millet yielded consistently. Implications: Under the sustainable practices of the present study, proso millet outperformed maize for yield and WUE stability, as well as potential costs saved, related to the production amount per unit area and potential revenue.","Marta"

The plant species evaluated were Fagonia indica, Aerva javanica, Calotropis procera, Rhazya stricta and Withania coagulans. In a greenhouse experiment, 5 sprouted and 5 non-sprouted tubers of nutsedge were planted in pots containing 250g field-collected soil. Pots were irrigated regularly with aqueous extracts of test plants at five concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%; original extract was concentrated 20 times and was considered as 100% concentrated and further concentrations were made accordingly). Extracts of all test plants significantly inhibited nutsedge tuber sprouting and growth. A significant interaction was observed between sprouting index (SI) and final sprouting percentage. While a non-significant interaction was observed between the timing of sprouting initiation and mean sprouting time (MST). Maximum reductions in SI and final sprouting percentage were recorded with Rhazya stricta extracts. Extracts of Rhazya stricta showed maximum suppressive potential of nutsedge density, root and shoot length, root and shoot fresh and dry weight. Overall, the least effective suppression of purple nutsedge was observed for extracts of Fagonia indica. Calotropis procera extracts resulted in the lowest reductions in nutsedge root length of all test plants but all test plants showed similar effects on timing of sprouting initiation and mean sprouting time. The 100% and 75% concentrations provided complete suppression of nutsedge. For all test plants, the 25% extract concentration was least effective and in some cases results were similar to the water-only control treatment. Our findings suggest that several dryland plant species with strong allelochemical properties have the potential to substantially reduce the deleterious impacts of purple nutsedge in dryland cropping systems and warrant further study.","Marta"

Using Striga seed dependency on host-released germination stimulants, we have developed and validated a method for addressing the problem of accumulated parasite seedbanks-the major obstacle in combating Striga infestation in African rain-fed fields. Application of our method promises to alleviate the problem posed by this pernicious weed by increasing crop production for smallholder farmers.SummaryThe root parasitic plant Striga hermonthica is a major threat to global food security, causing enormous losses in yields of the main staple crops in sub-Saharan Africa, which include pearl millet, sorghum, maize and rice. Sustainable Striga control should ideally lead to the depletion of the vast, long-lived Striga seedbank, and this can be achieved by inducing suicidal seed germination through application of strigolactone (SL) analogs in the absence of host plants. However, this suicidal germination strategy has not been evaluated under the natural rain-fed conditions that prevail in Striga-prone regions. We have developed and validated a protocol for suicidal germination in laboratory and natural conditions in Striga-infested rain-fed African fields. Three SL analogs were tested and these resulted to between 65% and 55% reduction in Striga emergence in pearl millet and sorghum fields, respectively. We conclude that suicidal germination is an effective method for reducing the Striga seedbank. Moreover, the minimal demands of our protocol, in terms of water consumption and amount of selected SL analogs, make it affordable and applicable at a large scale in African rain-fed agriculture, holding promise for sustainable cleaning of heavily Striga-infested fields in sub-Saharan Africa.","Marta"

Because of its practical uses for land preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen, invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces crop yields.Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha). Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one year may be poorest in the next.We answer the question: Why would a farmer in this district choose to apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment, georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map data for that paddock in many past seasons? We show that soil conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging.If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season, applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable.We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable, fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices. Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1% increase in yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7% decrease in applied N. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.","Marta"

Striga-resistant sorghum cultivars could be an important part of integrated S.hermonthica control. For effective resistance breeding, knowledge about the diversity of the parasite is essential. This study aimed (i) to determine the genetic diversity within and between seven S.hermonthica populations from East and West Africa using 15 microsatellite markers and (ii) to assess the virulence and host-parasite interactions of these Striga populations grown on 16 diverse sorghum genotypes in a glasshouse trial. Most of the genetic variance (91%) assessed with microsatellite markers occurred within S.hermonthica populations. Only a small portion (8%) occurred between regions of origin of the populations. A positive correlation (R-2=0.14) between pairwise geographic and genetic distances reflected the slightly increasing differentiation of S.hermonthica populations with increasing geographic distance. East African S.hermonthica populations, especially those from Sudan, had significantly greater average infestation success across all sorghum genotypes than West African populations. Some specific host-parasite interaction effects were observed. The high genetic variation among individuals of each S.hermonthica population underlines the high potential adaptability to different hosts and changing environments. This points to the need to manage sorghum resistance alleles in space and time and to employ resistant varieties as part of integrated S.hermonthica control, so as to hinder the parasite overcoming resistance.","Marta"

Being a major form of nitrogen fertilizer, large applications of urea assist cereals in approaching their genetic yield potential, but due to the low nitrogen-use efficiency of crops, this practice poses a severe threat to the environment through their hypertrophication. To date, except for paddy rice, little is known about the biological basis for urea movement in dryland crops. Here, we report the molecular and physiological characterization of a maize urea transporter, ZmDUR3. We show using gene prediction, PCR-based cloning and yeast complementation, that a functional full-length cDNA encoding a 731 amino acids-containing protein with putative 15 transmembrane alpha-helixes for ZmDUR3 was successfully cloned. Root-influx studies using N-15-urea demonstrated ZmDUR3 catalyzes urea transport with a K (m) at similar to 9 A mu M when expressed in the Arabidopsis dur3-mutant. qPCR analysis revealed that ZmDUR3 mRNA in roots was significantly upregulated by nitrogen depletion and repressed by reprovision of nitrogen after nitrogen starvation, indicating that ZmDUR3 is a nitrogen-responsive gene and relevant to plant nitrogen nutrition. Moreover, detection of higher urea levels in senescent leaves and obvious occurrence of ZmDUR3 transcripts in phloem-cells of mature/aged leaves strongly implies a role for ZmDUR3 in urea vascular loading. Significantly, expression of ZmDUR3 complemented atdur3-mutant of Arabidopsis, improving plant growth on low urea and increasing urea acquisition. As it also targets to the plasma membrane, our data suggest that ZmDUR3 functions as an active urea permease playing physiological roles in effective urea uptake and nitrogen remobilization in maize.","Marta"

Late Shang (1300-1046 BCE) expansion into Northern Shandong, driven by the Shang polity's control over Laizhou Bay salt resources, catalyzed regional revitalization, yet the agricultural foundations of this transformation remain poorly defined. Through AMS 14C dating, systematic analysis of carbonized plant remains from the Chengxixincun site, and synthesis of regional archaeobotanical datasets, we reconstruct Late Shang agricultural practices in Northern Shandong. Results of the site reveal a foxtail millet (Setaria italica)-dominated dryland system (93.24 % by count; 92.78 % ubiquity), supplemented by broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum, 6.12 %), with wheat (Triticum aestivum), soybean (Glycine max), and rice (Oryza sativa) as marginal crops. Weed and fruit remains attest to complementary wild resource exploitation. Comparative analysis demonstrates that Northern Shandong transitioned from Longshan-era rice-millet systems to intensified millet agriculture during Yueshi-period aridification (impact of the 4.2 ka BP event), later amplifying foxtail millet's dominance under Late Shang climatic amelioration and Central Plains agrotechnical diffusion. Crucially, rice cultivation-though never recovering Longshanera prominence-persisted regionally (1.40 %), contrasting sharply with its near absence in contemporaneous Central Plains sites (0.03 %). This trajectory underscores the resilience of regional agricultural traditions amid climatic fluctuations and their negotiated adaptation to Shang cultural expansion, as ecological constraints and imperial resource demands shaped divergent agricultural pathways. By bridging archaeobotanical data with climatic and cultural proxies, this study establishes the first empirical model of agricultural adaptation in Shang frontier zones, redefining understandings of subsistence resilience and resource politics in early territorial states.","Marta"

Their participation in the salinity stress of the key forage legume species alfalfa (Medicago sativa) was investigated here by comparing the transcriptomes of the two cultivars Dryland (DL) and Sundory (SD), which differed with respect to their ability to tolerate salinity stress. When challenged by the stress, DL plants were better able than SD ones to scavenge reactive oxygen species. A large number of genes encoding transcription regulators, signal transducers and proteins involved in both primary and secondary metabolism were differentially transcribed in the two cultivars, especially when plants were subjected to salinity stress. The set of induced genes included 17 MYB family of transcription factors, all of which were subsequently isolated. The effect of constitutively expressing these genes on the salinity tolerance expressed by Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. The introduction of MsMYB4 significantly increased the plants' salinity tolerance in an abscisic acid-dependent manner. A sub-cellular localization experiment and a transactivation assay indicated that MsMYB4 was deposited in the nucleus and was able to activate transcription in yeast. Based on this information, we propose that the MsMYB4 products is likely directly involved in alfalfa's response to salinity stress.","Marta"

The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of available soil water at planting and N fertilizer on grain sorghum yield and net return. The study was conducted near Hays, KS, from Summer 1971 to Fall 2002. Treatments were four N rates (0, 22, 45 and 67 kg N ha(-1)) and depth of moist soil determined prior to sorghum planting each year. Results showed a -0.96, 14.4, 29.3, and 36.5 kg ha(-1) yield change per kg N applied for very low yielding (yield < 1,269 kg ha(-1)), low yielding (1,269< yield <2,611), high yielding (2,611< yield <3,986), and very high yielding (yield > 3,986 kg ha(-1)) environments, respectively. Sorghum yield increased by rates of 9.6 and 20.4 kg ha(-1) per mm increase in available soil water (ASW) at planting for 0 and 67 kg N ha(-1), respectively. A multilinear function showed that grain yield increased by 20 kg ha(-1) for each kg N ha(-1) applied, by 15 kg ha(-1) for each mm increase in ASW, and by 0.67 kg ha(-1) for each mm increase of in-season precipitation (ISP). Net return was negative for all environments when depth of moist soil at planting was <= 76 cm. We concluded that ASW prior to planting is critical for sorghum production and can be used to adjust sorghum N fertilizer rates early in the season.","Marta"

Conservation Agriculture (CA) considered as climate-smart agriculture, strives to achieve acceptable profits along with high and sustained production levels while concurrently conserving and regenerating soils and protecting the environment. The objectives of this paper are to review and synthesize available findings on CA, its past trends, current opportunities and challenges, evidence on potential benefits from its adaptation, to discuss its future outlook, and to make relevant recommendations for interventions and novel research needs for its wider diffusion in the region.In MENA, major research on CA has been mainly conducted in Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, and Syria, while Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt embarked CA research fairly recently. About 25-40% out of the 53 million hectares total arable land is estimated to be suitable for CA in the region. In recent years a growing number of studies carried under a range of climatic, soil, management and cropping conditions in many countries of MENA reported several benefits including higher and more stable yields and profits, reduced risks of crop loss, labor requirements, soil erosion, and improved soil moisture and quality under CA system. Despite its benefits, adoption of CA in MENA is still very low for various reasons including: lack of affordable and well-adapted seeders, the complexity of the CA system which posed a major challenge for mostly uneducated farmers to comprehend, ill-conceived policies that promote cereal intensification hence inadvertently promote monocropping, tradeoffs between residue retention and livestock feed, lack of adequate policy and institutional framework and incentives to enhance farmers' adoption, and the private sector's active involvement in the dissemination of CA. The wider acceptance of CA requires the development of affordable and versatile no-till seeder alongside the implementation of integrated crop management practices. CA-based bundled agronomic management practices must be tailored to the biophysical and socio-economic environment. Finally, effective strategies for upscaling CA in MENA has to be developed by taking into consideration the unique features of the region. Despite the daunting past adoption trends and current challenges, we predict a bright future for CA in the region due to several factors including: rising energy prices and wage rates, the emergence of younger and more educated farmers, the advent of climate change, the increasing awareness on the degradation of land and water resources among farmers and policy makers, changes in dietary preferences subsequently increasing trends in demand and prices of legumes are expected to increase the desirability of CA and enhance its wider diffusion in MENA.","Marta"

Increase in rice production has come mainly from increased harvested area. Yield increase has been limited and the current average yield in SSA is around 2 t ha(-1). This paper aims to provide the status quo of (i) current rice production and its challenges, (ii) selected achievements in rice agronomy research mainly by the Africa Rice Center and its partners, and (iii) perspectives for future research on rice agronomy in SSA. The major problems confronting rice production include low yield in rainfed environments, accounting for 70% of the total rice harvested area. Rainfed rice yields are strongly affected by climate extremes such as water stresses, soil-related constraints, and sub-optimum natural resource management and crop management practices by smallholder farmers including poor water management, and suboptimal use of fertilizers, herbicides, and machineries. For alleviating these constraints, a wide range of technologies have been developed and introduced over the last three decades. These include water conservation technologies in rainfed and irrigated lowland rice, site-specific nutrient management practices, decision support tools such as crop growth simulation models, and labor-saving technologies. We conclude that further research efforts are needed to develop locally adapted agronomic solutions for sustainable intensification, especially in rainfed rice to enhance the resilience to climate change and increase land and labor productivity and sustainability of rice cultivation in SSA.","Marta"

A 6-year rainfed cropping systems experiment was conducted near Ritzville, Washington USA from 2015 to 2021. The objective was to compare performance of winter and spring canola, winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) (WT), and winter wheat (WW) and measure their effects on soil water dynamics and subsequent performance of spring wheat (SW). Overwinter soil water gain in canola stubble was significantly reduced compared to water gain in WT and WW stubble. The more winter precipitation, the greater the differences in soil water among treatments in early spring. There was a trend in all years for diminished overwinter soil water gain in canola stubble. Averaged over years, grain yield of SW was 1940, 2340, and 2210 kg/ha grown on canola, WT, and WW stubble, respectively (p = 0.045). Coefficients of determination from regression analysis conducted each year showed a high correlation between water content in the 180 cm profile in early spring and SW grain yield, except in one year of extreme drought. This paper provides a first report in a Mediterranean climate region of decline in wheat grain yield after canola versus after a cereal crops, primarily due to reduced overwinter soil water storage.","Marta"

The understanding of such interdependencies can be relevant to understand weed population dynamics in dryland cereal fields and may enhance management strategies for weed control. We used spatial statistical tools derived from point process theory. In particular, we compared the two spatial configurations by assuming two different point patterns. We did so by replacing the random weed fields by a related point pattern and comparing it with the point pattern of harvester ants. Our results suggest that areas with a high density of ant nests are, in this case study, in areas with low weed richness and that large nests have a greater impact than small nests. Considering that only one field was analysed, preserving and enhancing regular ant nest distributions, especially of large nests, might have an impact on depleting weeds and consequently enhancing weed control.","Marta"

This field-plot experiment on Tetonia silt loam (Pachic Cryoboroll-coarse silty, mixed) tested the degree of downy brome control obtained with 3 initial stubble-mulch tillage dates, 2 final rod weeding dates, and 3 winter wheat planting dates. Downy brome was best controlled with a combination of initial tilling early in the spring and a final rod weeding just before the late (15 Sept.) wheat planting date. The early tillage killed downy brome before they produced seed. This also resulted in sufficient soil moisture retention in the seed zone for fall germination of other downy brome seeds, which were then killed by the final rod weeding just before the late wheat planting. A reduction in natural downy brome emergence was observed at later fall dates. This was confirmed in a separate field-plot experiment (Portneuf silt loam, xerollic Calciorthid, coarse, silty, mixed) where downy brome seed was planted at several dates, and helped explain some of the benefits of the mentioned late rod weeding and planting treatment. These procedures incorporating stubble-mulch fallow are recommended, as normally practiced moldboard plowing creates an erosion hazard.","Marta"

The aim of the present study was to determine the existence of long-term trends in a weed community and to identify the factors that determine them. A common trend was extracted that captured the main signal of abundance over time, indicating latent influences affecting all species. Canonical correlation analysis showed strong associations between the common trend and specific weed species, suggesting differential responses to this latent factor. Local (temperature and precipitation) and global weather factors (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)) were considered as explanatory variables to explain the common trend. The local weather variables considered did not play a significant role in explaining the commonly observed trend. Conversely, NAO showed a significant relationship with the weed community, indicating its potential role in shaping long-term weed dynamics. DFA was found to be useful for studying the variability in multivariate weed time-series without the need for detailed a priori information on the underlying mechanisms governing weed population dynamics. Overall, this study provided valuable insights into the long-term drivers of weed dynamics and set the stage for future research in this area.","Marta"

This study, conducted from 2011 to 2014 in a Mediterranean environment, evaluated the changes in weed community composition in two cropping systems [conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG)] with different soil tillage [inversion tillage (IT) and non-inversion tillage (NoIT)] in a wheat-tomato-chickpea rotation that began in 2000. The treatments were replicated three times according to a randomised complete block design. The organic system was managed according to EU regulations. Inversion tillage consisted of mouldboard ploughing to a depth of 30cm, while NoIT consisted of subsoiling to a depth of 20cm. Weed control was based on herbicide application in CONV and mechanical weeding in ORG. The organic non-inversion system showed the highest weed biomass (134, 128 and 195gdry matter (DM)m(-2) in wheat, tomato and chickpea, respectively) and weed density (66, 77 and 76plantsm(-2) in wheat, tomato and chickpea, respectively), as well as community richness. However, ORG always increased weed diversity, even if annual dicotyledon species were abundant in ORG-IT and perennial dicotyledon species in ORG-NoIT. The conventional system enhanced the relative frequency of both annual (CONV-IT) and perennial (CONV-NoIT) grasses. There was a negative correlation between density of perennial weeds and crop yield (r(2)=0.24, P<0.001). Therefore, in the Mediterranean environment, combining organic practices with non-inversion tillage could lead to the establishment of perennial weeds that are difficult to control, thus requiring specific weed management practices.","Marta"

This is particularly true in low-input rice-based cropping systems in the Malagasy highlands, where weed management is mainly done by manual removal. Crop rotation is often promoted as an efficient way to control weed infestations, while the role of fertilization is more controversial. In this study, we compared rice monoculture to three rainfed rice-based two-year rotations: rice followed by groundnut, rice followed by sorghum-cowpea mixture, and rice followed by a velvet-bean crotalaria mixture. Each rotation was tested with two levels of fertilization (5 t DM ha(-1) organic manure, sole or in combination with mineral fertilizer - 400 kg ha(-1) NPK + 200 kg ha(-1) urea). We assessed the effect of rotation and fertilization on weed composition, diversity, biomass and rice yield. Additionally, the farmers' perception of weed harmfulness and the relation between their assessment of weed harmfulness and rice production was tested. Our results showed that weed biomass significantly decreased rice yield but only under the low fertilization level. The rotation of rice with the velvet beancrotalaria mixture was efficient in reducing weed biomass, modified weed community composition and allowed to achieve the highest rice yield. A significant negative relationship was found between weed community harmfulness index and weed species richness. Yet, the lowest rice yield was observed under rice monoculture despite a higher species richness over years and under high fertilization level. The lack of significant correlation between the harmfulness index and the actual rice yield is probably because our index is partly based on farmer's perception, and only on major weeds. More studies on tropical weed harmfulness are needed to support the design of ecologically intensified cropping systems.","Marta"

In these crops, 83-88 % of TNP was represented by above-ground net productivity (ANP). A reduction in tillage, from conventional to zero, especially when combined with residue retention, reduced the crop TNP/weed TNP ratio, reflecting the abundance of weeds with zero tillage. In both crops, minimum tillage increased grain yields, compared with conventional, but zero tillage resulted in reduced yields. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) and N-mineralization rates were higher in rice than in barley, and were maximum in the MT + R treatment. Crop productivity and grain yield in different treatments were positively correlated with MBC, MBN, N-mineralization rate and available-N. Strong negative correlations between crop productivity and grain yield with weed TNP and N-uptake were recorded. This study suggests that retention of a small fraction (one-third) of above-ground biomass from the previous crop and its incorporation in the soil through minimum tillage enhances the crop productivity and grain yield of succeeding crops and promotes soil fertility in a cereal based tropical dryland agro-ecosystem.","Marta"

We investigated the impact of herbicide, alone or in combination with soil amendments, on crop and weed productivity and microbial biomass in a rice (Oryza sativa)-barley (Hordeum vulgare)-summer fallow rotation in a tropical rainfed agroecosystem. Total net productivity (TNP) of crops was greater with herbicide (Butachlor) + chemical fertilizer (NPK), herbicide + farmyard animal manure, and herbicide + green manure (Sesbania aculeata) than with herbicide + crop residue (Triticum aestivum straw), herbicide only, and the control without amendment. Weed TNP was highest in the control, lowest in herbicide only, and intermediate in combined herbicide and amendment treatments except herbicide + crop residue. The sum of crop TNP and weed TNP was highest in herbicide + green manure and lowest in herbicide only. Microbial biomass C and N were greater with herbicide and amendment treatments than with herbicide only. Microbial biomass showed distinct temporal variation. Yearly plant input to soil had strong correlation with microbial biomass in the control and herbicide only treatments. In these agroecosystems, combining organic soil amendments with herbicide application could help sustain soil fertility and maintain higher total biological productivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Crop rotation and conservation tillage appears to serve as an effective strategy to optimize water resources distribution and utilization. From 2007-2019, a 12-yr in-situ experiment consisting of three cropping systems (winter wheat continuous cropping, WW; winter wheat-spring maize rotation, WM; spring maize continuous cropping, MM) and two tillage methods (conservation tillage, subsoiling, ST; conventional tillage, plowing, CT) were conducted in a semi-arid region, and grain yield, economic profit, water use, precipitation storage and loss, soil water balance were analyzed to explore the mechanism and potential of crop rotation and conservation tillage regulating soil water balance and increasing farmland productivity. Our results show that compared to WW, WM and MM significantly enhanced grain yield by 4358 and 8791 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle, respectively. And ST increased grain yield after 3 cycles with 979 kg ha-1. WM and MM with ST significantly reduced precipitation loss (78 and 135 mm) during the fallow period, and increased WUE (6.5 and 10.8 kg ha-1 mm-1), compared to WW-CT. With the passage of time, soil water storage of WW and MM showed a decreasing trend in 100-200 and 0-100 cm layers compared to pre-experiment, with the rate of 18.1 and 13.6 mm per cycle. And ST could ease the downward trend, relative to CT. However, the WM-ST maintained soil water balance by regulating water use and precipitation storage, compared to the two continuous cropping systems. Additionally, correlation analysis showed that evapotranspiration was positive to soil water balance and we should consider crop water use when designing cropping system to prevent soil water deficit. Overall, the WM-ST achieved better soil water sustainability, on the basis of sacrificing grain yield partly (4646 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle) compared to MM-ST, which perhaps more eco-friendly and sustainable agricultural technique to replace WW-CT in the Loess Plateau of China.","Marta"

Its infestation is Petrobia latens confined to relatively dry regions. It remains active during winter season with peak activity in March. In current study, mite population was recorded in wheat fields from 2004 to 2022 at Ludhiana, India. The population was recorded at 7 days interval, from 30 days after sowing till crop harvest and, correlated with meteorological data through multi-linear models fitted using the REG procedure in SAS model. In addition, periodic surveillance was also carried out in rainfed areas of Punjab-Himachal Pradesh border areas and field areas of Rajasthan. The results revealed that, in general, mite population starts increasing from January-February onwards, reached highest in March and, declined thereafter near crop harvest in April. The mite population showed a positive correlation with maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity and sunshine, and a negative correlation with rainfall. A distribution map of was prepared. The incidence of brown wheat mite was P. latens observed on other crops also, including spices, weeds and pulses. The natural enemies belonging to family Anystidae, Phytoseiidae grubs and adults of Coccinellidae were also recorded","Marta"

Therefore, judicious use of N fertilizer is a management priority in wheat (Triticum aestivum L,)-sorghum [Sorghum biocolor (L,) Moench]- fallow (W-S-F) rotations. The objectives of this study were to: (i) determine the long-term effects of N fertilization (0, 20, 40, and 60 lb N/acre) on grain yields of winter wheat and grain sorghum under three tillage systems, (ii) investigate the effect of soil moisture at or near planting on grain yields, and (iii) evaluate the residual profile soil inorganic N after 20 yr of N fertilization in the three tillage systems. The study involved a W-S-F rotation under three tillage systems on a nearly level Harney silt loam soil (fine, montmorillonite, mesic Typic Argiustoll), The three tillage systems were clean-till (CT), reduced-till (RT), and no-till (NT), Nitrogen was broadcast preplant as ammonium nitrate on each crop at rates of 0, 20, 40, and 60 Ib N/acre, As the level of soil moisture increased in each tillage system, there was a corresponding larger yield increase of wheat and sorghum to applied N, The correlation of grain yields of wheat and sorghum with soil profile N at all depths was highest for nitrate N and lowest for ammonium and total inorganic N. For all three tillage systems, sampling deeper than 6 in, resulted in little improvement in the coefficient of determination (R-2) for grain yields regressed on soil nitrate N, Residual soil nitrate N was highest in the top 6 in., dropped significantly in the 6- to 12-in. depth, and remained relatively low thereafter throughout the 72-in. sampling depth. Data from this long-term study showed the optimum broadcast N rate was approximately 60 Ib N/acre applied on each crop grown in a W-S-F rotation with the exact rate depending on soil moisture, fertilizer, and crop prices, Yields from CT were comparable with RT on this nearly level upland soil but failed to meet the residue requirements mandated in conservation compliance plans, Poorer stands, increased weed competition, and drier soils resulted in generally lower yields from NT plots. Considering all factors, RT systems for dryland wheat and sorghum production are recommended on upland fertile soils in the west central Great Plains.","Marta"

Correlation of heading date, plant height, grain test weight and grain yield with chaff IVOMD were calculated to determine if high chaff IVOMD was negatively correlated with agronomic traits important in grain production. Typical chaff piles were also sampled to determine the content of true chaff, weed seed and grain in them. Chaff IVOMD, ash and CP levels differed as much or more among cultivars of each species as between the 2 yr. Chaff IVOMD differed by 84, 136, 106 and 56 g kg-1; chaff ash by 45, 68, 52 and 49 g/kg-1; chaff CP by 17, 25, 41 and 26 g/kg-1 among cultivars of winter wheat, spring wheat, barley and oat, respectively. The chaff P (without high P fertilization) conc differed by 0.3, 1.7, 1.7 and 2.4 g kg-1 among cultivars of winter wheat, spring wheat, barley and oat, respectively. High P fertilization and variation between years increased chaff P conc of barley, spring wheat and oat 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 times, respectively. High chaff IVOMD was generally not negatively correlated with agronomic traits important in grain production. Typical chaff piles of winter wheat, spring wheat, barley and oat consisted of 898, 58 and 44 g/kg-1 of true chaff, weed seed and cereal grain, respectively.","Marta"

The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of a number of single and multiple stress laboratory tests in predicting relative emergence of 18 undeteriorated seed lots of wheat (six wheat cultivars, each represented by three seed lots from different production localities) at two field trial sites. There was a lack of significant correlations at one site, but a considerable number at the other. Single stress tests (germination at 9-degrees-C and thermotolerance induction response) were better predictors of relative emergence than multiple stress tests (accelerated ageing and the complex stressing vigour test). Promising results were also obtained with the standard germination test, which included a determination of speed of germination.","Marta"

Seven winter wheat cultivars were hybridized in a Griffing's half-diallel mating design, method 2 (reciprocals excluded, parents included), model 1 (fixed), and the progeny analyzed for coleoptile length in the F(1) through F(4) for response to selection, general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA) and heritability. Highly significant differences existed for GCA among progeny in each generation. SCA was highly significant in the F(1), F(2) and F(4), although SCA estimates were inconsistent among generations in each progeny population. The SCA/GCA ratio was 0.15, 0.11, 0.06 and 0.04 in the F(1) through the F(4), respectively, indicating that additive effects increased with homozygosity. Broad-sense heritability for coleoptile length was estimated at 0.86, 0.76, 0.60 and 0.78 for the F(1) through the F(4), respectively. Realized heritabilities ranged from -0.16 to 0.85 with a mean of 0.32 in the F(3) and ranged from -0.68 to 0.68 with a mean of 0.13 in the F(4). Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (R(S)) were significant for all generation comparisons except the F(1):F(2), indicating that changes in rank for coleoptile length were insignificant. Cultivars with long coleoptiles and high GCA were the best parents for improving coleoptile length. Sustained selection over generations for coleoptile length was more effective than one generation of selection for genotypes both with and without reduced height genes.","Marta"
186,NA,"not vetted","Dissecting the Genetics of Early Vigour to Design Drought-Adapted Wheat","Due to the climate change and an increased frequency of drought, it is of enormous importance to identify and to develop traits that result in adaptation and in improvement of crop yield stability in drought-prone regions with low rainfall. Early vigour, defined as the rapid development of leaf area in early developmental stages, is reported to contribute to stronger plant vitality, which, in turn, can enhance resilience to erratic drought periods. Furthermore, early vigour improves weed competitiveness and nutrient uptake. Here, two sets of a multi-reference nested association mapping (MR-NAM) population of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum L.) were used to investigate early vigour in a rain-fed field environment for 3 years, and additionally assessed under controlled conditions in a greenhouse experiment. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from red/infrared light reflectance was used to quantify early vigour in the field, revealing a correlation (p < 0.05; r = 0.39) between the spectral measurement and the length of the second leaf. Under controlled environmental conditions, the measured projected leaf area, using a green-pixel counter, was also correlated to the leaf area of the second leaf (p < 0.05; r = 0.38), as well as to the recorded biomass (p < 0.01; r = 0.71). Subsequently, genetic determination of early vigour was tested by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the proxy traits, revealing 42 markers associated with vegetation index and two markers associated with projected leaf area. There are several quantitative trait loci that are collocated with loci for plant developmental traits including plant height on chromosome 2D (log(10) (P) = 3.19; PVE = 0.035), coleoptile length on chromosome 1B (-log(10) (P) = 3.24; PVE = 0.112), as well as stay-green and vernalisation on chromosome 5A (-log(10) (P) = 3.14; PVE = 0.115).","Marta"

Striga-resistant sorghum cultivars could be an important part of integrated S.hermonthica control. For effective resistance breeding, knowledge about the diversity of the parasite is essential. This study aimed (i) to determine the genetic diversity within and between seven S.hermonthica populations from East and West Africa using 15 microsatellite markers and (ii) to assess the virulence and host-parasite interactions of these Striga populations grown on 16 diverse sorghum genotypes in a glasshouse trial. Most of the genetic variance (91%) assessed with microsatellite markers occurred within S.hermonthica populations. Only a small portion (8%) occurred between regions of origin of the populations. A positive correlation (R-2=0.14) between pairwise geographic and genetic distances reflected the slightly increasing differentiation of S.hermonthica populations with increasing geographic distance. East African S.hermonthica populations, especially those from Sudan, had significantly greater average infestation success across all sorghum genotypes than West African populations. Some specific host-parasite interaction effects were observed. The high genetic variation among individuals of each S.hermonthica population underlines the high potential adaptability to different hosts and changing environments. This points to the need to manage sorghum resistance alleles in space and time and to employ resistant varieties as part of integrated S.hermonthica control, so as to hinder the parasite overcoming resistance.","Marta"

Moisture (rainfall or sprinkler irrigation) was a major factor influencing the decline in residual activity of carbaryl, carbaryl-oil, phosmet, and Penncap-M. Residual activity of diazinon and malathion was negligible at 7 days, regardless of the amount of moisture. In tests comparing dryland and sprinkler-irrigated treatments, there was a significant negative correlation (r = -0.91) between percent control and the amount of water applied. Both linear and quadratic effects were highly significant (P < 0.005). There were no significant linear or quadratic effects detected between percent control and days postapplication. Carbaryl-oil, diluted with 1/4 part diesel fuel, and carbaryl-XLR provided slightly shorter residual activity than undiluted carbaryl-oil treatments. All 3 treatments provided considerably longer residual activity than other insecticides tested.","Marta"
